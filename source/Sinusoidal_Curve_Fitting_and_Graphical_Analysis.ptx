  <title>Sinusoidal Curve Fitting and Graphical Analysis</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this chapter, we learn that sinusoidal patterns exist in various aspects throughout our world. One example is the moon, which undergoes phases oscillating from no illumination, to waxing (increasing illumination), reaching a fully lit moon, and then waning (decreasing illumination) until it completes its cycle with no illumination again. Indigenous cultures across the world have deeply connected with these lunar cycles, shaping cultural practices aligned with the moon's phases. For example, the Māori of New Zealand and the Hopi Tribe in northeastern Arizona, USA, both time activities such as planting and harvesting specific plants for each moon cycle based on generations of lunar observations.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="graphs_of_the_sine_and_cosine_functions"/>, we graphed sinusoidal functions and determined their values for any given input value. The ability to formulate a sinusoidal equation modeling the moon's phases allows us to predict the moon's phase on any date. In this section, we will explore the process of developing sinusoidal functions based on provided information. This will enable us to model real-world phenomena using real data.

      <title>Finding an Equation of a Sine Function Using its Characteristics</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Write an equation of a sine function with an amplitude of 2, period of 8, phase shift of <m>\frac{\pi}{3}</m>, and vertical shift of 4.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          To determine an equation of the form
          <me>
            f(x)=A\sin(B(x-C))+D
          </me>
          we first examine the information that we are given: amplitude of 2, period of 8, phase shift of <m>\frac{\pi}{3}</m>, and vertical shift of 4.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since <m>|A|</m> represents the value of the amplitude, we get
          <me>
            |A|=2
          </me>.
          Thus we either have <m>A=2</m> or <m>A=-2</m>. Since we are not given a reflection about the <m>x</m>-axis, we can conclude that <m>A</m> is not negative, thus
          <me>
            A=2
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, since the period of a sine function is given by <m>\frac{2\pi}{|B|}</m>, we get
          <me>
            \frac{2\pi}{|B|}=8
          </me>.
          Solving for <m>|B|</m>, we get
          <me>
            |B|=\frac{2\pi}{8}=\frac{\pi}{4}.
          </me>
          Since there is no reflection about the <m>y</m>-axis, we have that <m>B</m> must be positive:
          <me>
            B=\frac{\pi}{4}.
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, since <m>C</m> and <m>D</m> represent the phase shift and vertical shift, respectively, we get
          <me>
            C=\frac{\pi}{3},\quad D=4
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Combining these, the sine function becomes:
          <me>
            f(x)=2\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\left(x-\frac{\pi}{3}\right)\right)+4
          </me>.

          Find an equation of the form <m>y = A\cos(B(x - C)) + D</m> that fits the graph.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The cosine function has its maximum when <m>x=0</m>, decreases to its minimum at <m>x=\pi</m>, and then increases before completing one period at <m>2\pi</m>. This graph starts at 0 when <m>x=0</m>, then increases to its maximum at <m>x=\frac{\pi}{2}</m>, and then has the shape of the cosine function starting at <m>x=0</m>. This represents a phase shift to the right. There no reflections about the <m>x</m>-axis or <m>y</m>-axis. We will find the equation of a function with characteristics of a phase shift to the right.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Amplitude (<m>A</m>)</em>: Since the amplitude of the cosine function will be the same as the amplitude of the sine function, which is 1, we have  <m>|A| = 1</m>. Since there is no reflection about the <m>x</m>-axis, we choose the positive value to get <m>A = 1</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Vertical Shift (D)</em>: The vertical shift of the cosine function will be the same as that of the sine function, which is 0. So, we have <m>D = 0</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Period (B)</em>: The period of the cosine function will also be the same as the period of the sine function, which is <m>2\pi</m>. Since <m>2\pi=\frac{2\pi}{|B|}</m>, we have <m>|B| = 1</m>. Since there is no reflection about the <m>y</m>-axis, we get <m>B = 1</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, we have
          <me>
            y=1\cos(1x)+0=\cos(x)
          </me>.
          Overlapping the graph of <m>y=\cos(x)</m> onto the original graph will help us determine the phase shift.

          </latex-image>
        </image>
        <p>
          <em>Phase Shift (C)</em>: From the graph, the cosine function will have a phase shift of <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m> radians to the right to match the graph of the sine function. This is because the cosine function reaches its maximum value at <m>x = 0</m>, while the sine function reaches its maximum at <m>x = \frac{\pi}{2}</m>. So, we have <m>C = \frac{\pi}{2}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, the equation of the cosine function that fits the graph of <m>y = \sin(x)</m> is:
          <me>
            y = \cos\left(x - \frac{\pi}{2}\right)
          </me>
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <remark>
      <p>
        Since this graph is the graph of <m>y=\sin(x)</m>, we get
        <me>
          \sin(x)=\cos\left(x-\frac{\pi}{2}\right)
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This solution demonstrates that any sine function can be written as a cosine function with an appropriate phase shift. In this case, the phase shift of <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m> radians to the right transforms the cosine function into its corresponding sine function.

            The sine function starts at the origin, increases to its maximum when <m>x=\frac{\pi}{2}</m>, decreases to its minimum at <m>x=\frac{3\pi}{2}</m>, and then increases again before completing one period at <m>2\pi</m>. In the given graph, the function has a value of 8 when <m>x=0</m>, then increases to its maximum value of 16 at <m>x=10</m>, decreases to its minimum value of 0 at <m>x=30</m>, and then increases again before completing one period at <m>x=40</m>. This indicates a vertical shift, a vertical stretch, and a horizontal stretch of the period. There are no reflections about the <m>x</m>-axis or <m>y</m>-axis. Therefore, we need to find the equation of a function with these characteristics."
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Amplitude (<m>A</m>)</em>: Recall from <xref ref="def-amplitude"/> that the amplitude is defined as half of the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the function. Here, the maximum value is 16 and the minimum value is 0, so the amplitude is:
            <me>|A| = \frac{16 - 0}{2} = 8</me>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since there are no reflections about the <m>x</m>-axis, we use the positive value to get <m>A = 8</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Vertical Shift (<m>D</m>)</em>: The midline, calculated as <me>y=\frac{\mbox{maximum}+\mbox{minimum}}{2}=\frac{16+0}{2}=8</me>, represents the vertical shift of the graph. Therefore, <me>D=8</me>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Period (<m>B</m>)</em>: The period of a function is the length of one full repetition (or cycle). We can identify the period on the graph by measuring the horizontal distance between corresponding points where the graph completes a cycle. In this case, we'll use two corresponding peaks at <m>x = 10</m> and <m>x = 50</m> to obtain:
            <me>
              \mbox{period }=50-10=40.
            </me>
            Note that other points on the graph, such as the minimum values or the points where the graph crosses the midline, could also be used to determine the period.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since <xref ref="def-period"/> defines a period as <m>\frac{2\pi}{|B|}</m>, we have:
            <me>
              40=\frac{2\pi}{|B|}.
            </me>
            Thus,
            <me>
              |B|=\frac{2\pi}{40}=\frac{\pi}{20}
            </me>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since there are no reflections about the <m>y</m>-axis, we get <m>B = \frac{\pi}{20}</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Phase Shift (<m>C</m>)</em>: The phase shift of the graph refers to its horizontal translation. The cycle of a sine function typically starts at <m>x = 0</m> on the midline, increases to the maximum, decreases, passes the midline to the minimum, and then completes a cycle back at the midline. Since this graph follows these characteristics without any horizontal translation, there is no phase shift. Therefore, <m>C = 0</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, the graph can be described by the following sine function:
            <me>
              f(x)=8\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{20}x\right)+8.

          <p>
            Since the cosine function has its maximum value when <m>x=0</m> before decreasing to its minimum and then increasing to complete one period, the graph provides several options for phase shifts. By selecting a peak and determining the direction and value of the phase shift needed for the cosine function to reach that peak, we can align it with the given graph. For example, if we choose the peak at <m>x=-30</m>, the cosine function will shift 30 units to the left. Similarly, for peaks at <m>x=10</m> or <m>x=50</m>, the cosine function would need to shift 10 or 50 units, respectively, to the right. Since the peak at <m>x=10</m> is the closest to the peak of the original cosine function when <m>x=0</m>, we opt for this phase shift. Additionally, as the graph of the sine function, there is a vertical shift, a vertical stretch, and a horizontal stretch, with no reflections about the <m>y</m>-axis or the <m>x</m>-axis.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Amplitude (<m>A</m>)</em>: The amplitude of a cosine function is the same as that of the corresponding sine function. Thus, <m>|A| = 8</m>. Since there are no reflections about the <m>x</m>-axis, we use the positive value to get <m>A = 8</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Vertical Shift (<m>D</m>)</em>: The vertical shift of a cosine function is the same as that of the corresponding sine function. Thus, <m>D = 8</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Period (<m>B</m>)</em>: The period of a cosine function is also the same as that of the corresponding sine function. In this case, <m>|B| = \frac{\pi}{20}</m>. Since there are no reflections about the <m>y</m>-axis, we determine <m>B = \frac{\pi}{20}</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before we examine the phase shift, let's summarize what we found so far:
            <me>
              g(x)=8\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{20}\left(x\right)\right)+8
            </me>
            and overlap this graph with the given graph  .

          In <xref ref="graphs_of_the_sine_and_cosine_functions"/> we learned that Earth's axis is tilted, and as the Earth orbits the sun, this axial tilt causes seasons, which are periodic. Another effect of the axial tilt and orbit is the amount of daylight each part of Earth experiences, which is also periodic.

          The total sunlight duration in Munda, on the island of New Georgia in the Solomon Islands in 2025, is plotted in <xref ref="fig-ex-munda-daylight"/>. On the 21st of June 2025 (the 172nd day of the year), which is the shortest day of the year in Munda, the total sunlight duration is 11 hours, 38 minutes, and 17 seconds (approximately 11.64 hours). Conversely, on the 22nd of December 2025 (the 356th day of the year), which is the longest day of the year, the total sunlight duration is 12 hours, 36 minutes, and 44 seconds (approximately 12.61 hours). Find a function of the form <m>y=A\cos(B(x-C))+D</m> to model the total hours of daylight in Munda in 2025, assuming that one period represents one year or 365 days.

          <em>Amplitude (<m>A</m>)</em>: From the definition of amplitude (<xref ref="def-amplitude"/>),

            |A| = \frac{\text{maximum} - \text{minimum}}{2} = \frac{12.61 - 11.64}{2} = 0.485

          Assuming no reflections about the <m>x</m>-axis, we have:

            A=0.485
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Period (<m>B</m>)</em>: We assume a period of one year or 365 days. Additionally, we can assume no reflections about the <m>y</m>-axis, leading to a positive value for <m>B</m>. Thus we have <m>\frac{2\pi}{B}=365</m> or

          <me>C=356</me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Vertical Shift (<m>D</m>)</em>: The value of the midline represents the average duration of daylight, which is the vertical shift:

            D = \frac{\text{maximum} + \text{minimum}}{2} = \frac{12.61 + 11.64}{2} = 12.125

        <p>
          Therefore, the equation of our function is

    <remark>
      <p>
        It's important to note that the average duration of daylight is not exactly 12 hours but instead approximately 12.125 hours. This discrepancy arises due to atmospheric refractions, which cause the apparent sunrise and sunset to occur slightly before and after, respectively, the sun crosses the horizon—the actual sunrise and sunset times.

          Since there are no reflections about the <m>x</m>-axis, we get <m>A=5.45</m>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Period (B)</em>: Since the temperatures repeat every 12 months, the period is 12 and so <m>\frac{2\pi}{|B|}=12</m>. Since there are no reflections about the <m>y</m>-axis, we keep the positive value to obtain
          <me>B=\frac{2\pi}{12}=\frac{\pi}{6}</me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Vertical Shift (<m>D</m>)</em>: The vertical shift is the average of the maximum and minimum values of the data, which corresponds to the midline of the graph:
          <me>
            D=\frac{\mbox{maximum}+\mbox{minimum}}{2}=\frac{17.5+6.6}{2}=12.05

        <p>
          <em>Phase Shift (<m>C</m>)</em>: The maximum temperature in the data occurs in January (<m>x=1</m>). However, since the graph of cosine reaches its maximum value at <m>x=0</m>, we have a phase shift of 1 to the right to align the peak with the maximum temperature data point. Thus, <m>C=1</m>.

      <title>Modeling the Moon Cycles</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          According to the Astronomical Almanac, the average moon cycle is about 29.53059 days, that is, it takes approximately 29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes, and 2.9 seconds for the moon to complete its cycle. Across the Pacific, from Chamorro, to Samoan, to Māori, and Tahitian culture, traditional practices including navigation as well as planting and fishing are tied to the moon phases. Develop a cosine function of the form
          <me>
            f(x)=A\cos(B(x-C))+D
          </me>
          to determine the percent of the moon that is illuminated as a function of time, where Day 0, representing the start of the moon cycle is the new moon with <m>0\%</m> illuminated, increasing until <m>100\%</m> of the moon is illuminated, and then decreasing back to <m>0%</m> illuminated, completing the cycle after 29.53059 days. Using the function you developed, determine what percent of the moon is illuminated (rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent) on Day 100, that is 100 days after the initial new moon.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Analyzing the question, we see that a period, or cycle of the moon, is 29.53059 days. The function will range from 0% to 100% illumination, representing the minimum and maximum of the function, respectively. To visualize the function and determine its characteristics, we first sketch the function.

          From the definition of amplitude (<xref ref="def-amplitude"/>),
          <me>
            |A|=\frac{100-0}{2}=50
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The characteristic of a cosine function is that at <m>x=0</m> the function is at its maximum value, before decreasing to its minimum value, and then back up to its maximum, completing one period. This curve, however, begins at its minimum value, increases to its maximum, before decreasing to its minimum. This change in pattern represents a reflection about the <m>x</m>-axis, thus the value for <m>A</m> is negative, giving us
          <me>
            A=-50
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, we know that the moon's cycle, or period is 29.53059 days. Therefore, we have
          <me>
            \frac{2\pi}{|B|}=29.53059
          </me>
          which leads to
          <me>
            |B|=\frac{2\pi}{29.53059}
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since there is no reflection about the y-axis, <m>B</m> is positive, resulting in
          <me>
            B=\frac{2\pi}{29.53059}
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is no phase shift (<m>C=0</m>) since the curve follows the characteristics of the cosine equation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The midline is at <m>50\%</m>, halfway between 0% and 100%, and representing a vertical shift of 50, so  <m>D=50</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, the equation of the function is
          <me>
            f(x)=-50\cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{29.53059}x\right)+50
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To determine the moon phase 100 days after the initial new moon, we evaluate our function at <m>x=100</m>:
          <me>
            f(100)=-50\cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{29.53059}\cdot100\right)+50=87.8\%

            What patterns do you observe when comparing the graphs of daylight hours for pairs of islands across different latitudes? Additionally, how does the variation in daylight hours change with increasing latitude, that is, as one moves away from the equator?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <answer>
          <p>
            The islands exhibit mirrored patterns in daylight hours, where one island experiences longer days while the other experiences shorter days. This is due to their opposite positions relative to the equator.
          </p>
          <p>
            As latitude increases (moving away from the equator), the variation in daylight hours also increases. Islands closer to the equator experience less variation in daylight hours throughout the year, while islands further away from the equator experience more changes in daylight hours between seasons.

          The islands of Oʻahu and Rarotonga are located at similar distances from the equator. However, they experience different climates due to their locations relative to the equator. Oʻahu is at 21.26° North, directly mirrored by Rarotonga at 21.26° South. The table below gives the average monthly temperatures (in °C) for each island. Use the data in the table to answer the following questions. Source: <url href="http://www.worldclimate.com"></url>, retrieved on 18 March, 2024.

            Based on the sinusoidal functions that you found, what can you conclude about the relationship between temperature and latitude?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <answer>
          <p>
            As latitude increases (moving away from the equator towards the poles), the sinusoidal function's amplitude increases, signifying greater temperature variability, while its vertical shift decreases, indicating lower average temperatures at higher latitudes.
