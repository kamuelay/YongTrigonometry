<p>Hawaii Ê» This is a test. Pacific Islanders have been wayfinding across long distances in the Pacific long before the magnetic compasses or other instruments were introduced. Navigators relied on observations of the stars, sun, ocean, winds, and other signs from nature to determine their position. Through time, much of the art and science of traditional wayfinding was lost across the Pacific, except with a few navigators. The island of Satawal in the Federated States of Micronesia was home to Mau Piailug, one of the last traditional navigators. To determine his position, Mau used the <em class="emphasis">paafu</em>,  a Micronesian <em class="emphasis">Star Compass</em>  which is mental construct used to help determine position by memorizing things important to navigation, such as the position of stars when they rise and set on the horizon. The star compass also reads the flight path of birds and the direction of winds and waves.</p>
