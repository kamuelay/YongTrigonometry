<p>“Before a voyage by sail begins, the wayfinder designs a course strategy and reference course for reaching the destination from the departure point, given the capabilities of the vessel and the winds, currents, and weather conditions anticipated along the way. (See ``Winds, Weather, and Currents of the Pacific.” ) The course strategy represents the most efficient way of getting to the destination. The wayfinder also chooses the best time to go (when the wind and weather conditions are the most favorable), taking into account the timing of the return voyage as well."</p>
