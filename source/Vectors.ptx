      The Hawaiʻiloa, a double-hulled voyaging canoe, was envisioned as the revival of traditional Hawaiian canoe-building techniques using native materials. However, in 1989-1990, after an extensive search throughout the state, it became apparent that Hawaiʻi's koa forests lacked accessible trees of sufficient size for the canoe's construction. To address this challenge, the search expanded beyond Hawaiʻi. Utilizing materials originating elsewhere in the Pacific aligns with the fact that storms have historically carried large trees from the Pacific Coast of North America to islands like Hawaii, where they've been used for canoe construction, and so the search expanded to North America.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two trees, each 200 feet high and over 400 years old, were discovered on Shelikof Island in Soda Bay, Prince of Wales Island, west of Ketchikan, Alaska. Following customary Hawaiian and Tlingit tree cutting ceremonies to seek permission, the trees were felled for the canoe. The logs then embarked on a 2,234-nautical-mile journey to Hawai`i, following a heading of <m>256^{\circ}</m>. This journey exemplifies a <term>vector</term>,<idx><h>vectors</h></idx> — a quantity possessing both <term>magnitude</term><idx><h>vectors</h><h>magnitude</h></idx> and <term>direction</term>.<idx><h>vectors</h><h>direction</h></idx>

      In physics, vectors are often represented with arrows, denoting their direction, while the length of the arrow signifies the vector's magnitude. Vectors play a fundamental role describing various things in the world around us. For example, movement of objects requires a magnitude and direction, the force exerted on an object requires the magnitude force used and the direction of the force. In this section, we will learn how to express vectors, both geometrically and analytically as well as the various properties of vectors.

      The Hawai`iloa is a double-hulled voyaging canoe whose construction was intended to recover knowledge and skills associated with traditional Hawaiian canoe-building with native materials. A major problem arose in 1989-1990 when it was determined that the koa forests in Hawai`i no longer had trees large enough to construct such a canoe so the search had to be extended beyond Hawaiʻi. Using trees that didn't originate in Hawai`i still followed the theme of using traditional materials because during storms, large trees from the Pacific Coast of North American have been known to have been swept into the Pacific Ocean and float to islands such as Hawai`i. Such trees have traditionally been used for canoe building across the Pacific. Two trees, each 200 feet high and over 400 years old were located in Shelikof Island in Soda Bay, Prince of Wales Island, west of Ketchikan, Alaska. Traditional Hawaiian and Tlingit tree cutting ceremonies were then performed to ask permission to take the trees to build a waʻa. The trees were then cut and the logs would need to make their way 2,234 nautical miles with a heading of <m>256^{\circ}</m> to Hawai`i. This is known as a <term>vector</term>,<idx><h>vectors</h></idx> because it has both a length and a direction. We represent a vector with an arrow to indicate its <term>direction</term>.<idx><h>vectors</h><h>direction</h></idx> The length of the arrow represents the <term>magnitude</term><idx><h>Vectors</h><h>Magnitude</h></idx> of the vector. See <xref ref="fig_Juneau-to-Honolulu">Figure</xref>. Many things in physics can be represented with vectors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heading is 256.3 deg, 2233.6 nautical miles

      The vector whose path begins at the point <m>P</m> and ends at the point <m>Q</m> is written as <m>\overrightarrow{PQ}</m>, where the arrow on top indicates the direction. The point <m>P</m> is called the <em>initial point</em><idx><h>Vectors</h><h>Initial Point</h></idx> and the point <m>Q</m> is called the <em>terminal point</em><idx><h>Vectors</h><h>Terminal Point</h></idx> of the vector <m>\overrightarrow{PQ}</m>. The <term>magnitude</term><idx><h>Vectors</h><h>Magnitude</h></idx> of <m>\overrightarrow{PQ}</m> is the length or distance and is written as <m>\|\overrightarrow{PQ}\|</m>. We can also think of <m>\overrightarrow{PQ}</m> as the <term>displacement</term>.<idx><h>Vectors</h><h>displacement</h></idx> The <term>direction</term><idx><h>Vectors</h><h>Direction</h></idx> of <m>\overrightarrow{PQ}</m> is from <m>P</m> to <m>Q</m>.
    </p>
    <remark>
      <title>Notation</title>
      <p>
        Another way to write a vector is with a lowercase, bold faced letter (with or without an arrow), <m>\mathbf{v}</m> or <m>{\overrightarrow{\mathbf{v}}}</m>. Typically, if you are writing a vector by hand, you will want to use the arrow, since it is difficult to tell if you are writing in bold or not.
      </p>
    </remark>
    <p>
      The <em>zero vector</em>,<idx><h>zero vector</h></idx> written as <m>\mathbf{0}</m> or <m>{\overrightarrow{\mathbf{0}}}</m>, is a vector with zero magnitude, meaning it has no displacement and it has no direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is important to note that a vector only requires a magnitude and direction, but it does not have a unique location. Thus, as long as the magnitude and direction aren't changed, a vector may be <term>translated</term><idx><h>Vectors</h><h>translation</h></idx> or moved from one place to another. As a result, if two vectors <m>\mathbf{v}</m> and <m>\mathbf{w}</m> have the same direction and the same magnitude, then they are <term>equal</term>, <idx><h>Vectors</h><h>Equal</h></idx> written as
      <me>
        \mathbf{v}=\mathbf{w}
      </me>.

          The average distanced travled by a waʻa in one day of sailing is 120 nautical miles. If the Nāmāhoe departed from Kaua`i, the Hawai`iloa departed from Oʻahu, the Moʻokiha departed from Maui, and the Makali`i departed from Hawai`i and all waʻa traveled for three days (<m>120\times3=360</m> miles) in the direction of Manu Koʻolau (NE), the resulting vectors from each waʻa will be equal since they all have the same direction (NE) and the same magnitude (360 miles). See <xref ref="fig_equal-vectors">Figure</xref>.

          If you stand in Tahiti and face Hawai`i, you would be looking at the Haka Hoʻolua house or north by west (NbW). When the H&#333;k&#363;leʻa sails from Tahiti to return home to Hawai`i, the navigator does not point H&#333;k&#363;leʻa directly to Hawai`i and sail to the Haka Hoʻolua house. Instead, H&#333;k&#363;leʻa sails north. When the navigator has determined that H&#333;k&#363;leʻa has reached the latitude of Hawai`i, about <m>20^{\circ}</m> N, the waʻa then turns west to come home. This method of navigation is called <em>latitude sailing</em>.<idx><h>latitude sailing</h></idx> For this strategy to work, the navigator must know their latitude which can be determined by (1) measuring altitude of Hokupa'a (North Star); (2) measuring the altitude of stars as they cross the meridian; or (3) watching for pairs of stars that rise or set together.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can represent H&#333;k&#363;leʻa's path north by the vector <m>\overrightarrow{PQ}</m> and the path west by the vector <m>\overrightarrow{QR}</m> then the resulting displacement is the same as if you were to sail directly from Tahiti to Hawai`i, represented by <m>\overrightarrow{PR}</m>. See <xref ref="fig_adding-vectors">Figure</xref>. We call the vector <m>\overrightarrow{PR}</m> the <em>sum</em><idx><h>Vectors</h><h>Sum</h></idx> of the vectors <m>\overrightarrow{PQ}</m> and <m>\overrightarrow{QR}</m> and we write
          <me>

      To find the <em>sum</em> of vectors <m>\mathbf{u}</m> and <m>\mathbf{v}</m>, we place the initial point of the second vector at the terminal (or end) point of the first vector. The vector formed from the initial point of the first vector to the terminal point of the second vector is the the sum of the two vectors, <m>\mathbf{u}+\mathbf{v}</m>. See <xref ref="fig_sum-of-vectors1">Figure</xref>. Since vectors can be translated, any two vectors can be added. Notice that adding the vector <m>\mathbf{v}</m> to <m>\mathbf{u}</m> results in the same vector obtained by adding <m>\mathbf{u}</m> to <m>\mathbf{v}</m>. Thus <m>\mathbf{u}+\mathbf{v}=\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{u}</m>.

    <title>Multiplying Vectors by a Scalar</title>
    <p>
      If a waʻa sails for two days at 5 knots, it will have covered 240 miles. This distance traveled is known as the magnitude of the vector and it is given as a real number. These real numbers are often referred to as <term>scalars</term>.<idx><h>scalar</h></idx> The magnitude of the vector that represents a waʻa's path for two days will be twice as big as the magnitude of the vector that represents the path a waʻa sailed for only one day. We now can define how we multiply a vector by a scalar.

    <title>Finding a Unit Vector</title>
    <p>
      Sometimes it is useful to look at problems involving vectors in terms of a vector in the same direction, but with a magnitude of one. Recall that a unit vector <m>\mathbf{u}</m> is a vector whose length is one, <m>\|\mathbf{u}\|=1</m>. To find a unit vector in the same direction, you will need to divide that vector by its length or magnitude.

This vector is called the <em>velocity vector</em><idx><h>vectors</h><h>velocity</h></idx> and can also be used to describe other physical objects and phenomena such as wind and currents.

          First we note that since the velocity is 10 knots, we have <m>\|\mathbf{v}\|=10</m>. Next we will need to find the direction. Since <m>\theta</m> is measured from the positive <m>x</m>-axis, we see that
          <me>
            \theta=90^{\circ}+22.5^{\circ}=112.5^{\circ}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          To find the vector, will need the horizontal and vertical components.
          <md>
            <mrow>v_x\amp =\amp \|\mathbf{v}\|\cos\theta=10\cos112.5^{\circ}\approx-3.8</mrow>
            <mrow>v_y\amp =\amp \|\mathbf{v}\|\sin\theta=10\sin112.5^{\circ}\approx9.2</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus
          <me>
            \mathbf{v}\approx-3.8\mathbf{i}+9.2\mathbf{j}=\langle-3.8,9.2\rangle
          </me>

          An estimate for the speed of Hikianalia is
          <m>\frac{1}{3}</m> the speed of the wind on a beam reach
          (wind is at a right angle to the waʻa).
          So if Hikianalia is sailing with winds at 15 knots,
          the speed of the waʻa is <m>\frac{1}{3}\cdot15=5</m> knots.
          However, if Hikianalia is sailing directly into a current of 2 knots, Hikianalia's actual speed will be slowed down to 3 knots.

        <p>
          It is very rare that a waʻa sailing on the ocean will be moving in the same direction it's pointed. One reason for this is that crosswind can push the waʻa off its course. The angle of displacement between the apparent heading of the waʻa and the direction the waʻa is actually traveling through the water is referred to as <em>leeway</em>.<idx><h>leeway</h></idx> Using vector addition, we can determine where the waʻa will actually travel. However, on the waʻa, the navigator can determine the leeway by observing the angle from the wake behind the waʻa and the apparent direction the waʻa is pointed towards.

          In order to compensate for the wind, the navigator must steer the waʻa into the wind by the same angle as the leeway angle. For example, if the waʻa needs to sail in the direction of Manu Malanai (SE) and the wind is pushing the waʻa one house further south, the waʻa will move towards Nālani Malanai (SEbS). To maintain the course of Manu Malanai, the navigator must then point the waʻa one house north with an apparent heading in the house of Noio Malanai (SEbE) in order for the actual heading to be in the house of Manu Malanai (SE).
