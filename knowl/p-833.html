<p>If you stand in Tahiti and face Hawai`i, you would be looking at the Haka Hoʻolua house or north by west (NbW). When the Hōkūleʻa sails from Tahiti to return home to Hawai`i, the navigator does not point Hōkūleʻa directly to Hawai`i and sail to the Haka Hoʻolua house. Instead, Hōkūleʻa sails north. When the navigator has determined that Hōkūleʻa has reached the latitude of Hawai`i, about <span class="process-math">\(20^{\circ}\)</span> N, the wa‘a then turns west to come home. This method of navigation is called <em class="emphasis">latitude sailing</em>.  For this strategy to work, the navigator must know their latitude which can be determined by (1) measuring altitude of Hokupa’a (North Star); (2) measuring the altitude of stars as they cross the meridian; or (3) watching for pairs of stars that rise or set together.</p>
