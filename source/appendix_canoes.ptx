<title>An Introduction to the Canoes in This Book</title>
<introduction>
    <p>
        Throughout this textbook, we reference several canoes that reflect the diverse traditions and practices of seafaring in the Pacific. Some of these canoes have traversed vast stretches of the ocean, while others are regional vessels that play vital roles in local education, cultural preservation, and community connection. In this appendix, we highlight each of these canoes to honor their contributions and emphasize the important role they play in sustaining ancestral knowledge and navigation practices.
