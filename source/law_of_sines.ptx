  <title>The Law of Sines</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Recall <xref ref="exmp-gift-for-mau"/> in <xref ref="inverse_trigonometry"/> where Alingano Maisu is sailing to her new home in Satawal. For the first leg of the voyage, we calculated that to sail from Johnston Atoll to Majuro, you would need to head towards House ʻĀina Kona (<m>27.4^{\circ}</m>). However, in reality, currents can push the waʻa off course. Let's consider a scenario where a current of 1 knot is flowing in the direction of the house Komohana (West). If we were to face Majuro and sail straight, the current would push us to the west of our destination. To ensure we arrive at Majuro, our apparent heading will need to be adjusted accordingly, as illustrated below.

      Now, suppose we sail at 5 knots. What heading should we aim for to compensate for a 2-knot current? We note that by alternate interior angles, <m>A=27.4^{\circ}</m>. Let's represent this situation with a triangle where the sides represent speed of the waʻa and the current, allowing us to disregard the distance traveled.

      It's important to note that this triangle is not a right triangle; instead, it's classified as an <term>oblique triangle</term>,<idx><h>oblique triangle</h></idx> meaning it does not have any right angles. Triangles can be further categorized as either <em>obtuse</em> or <em>acute</em>. An <term>obtuse triangle</term><idx><h>obtuse triangle</h></idx> contains one angle greater than <m>90^{\circ}</m>, while an <term>acute triangle</term><idx><h>acute triangle</h></idx> consists of all angles less than <m>90^{\circ}</m>. Solving such triangles requires different methods than those used for solving the right triangle in previous chapters. In this chapter, we'll learn techniques for solving oblique triangles, starting with the Law of Sines and the Law of Cosines.
    </p>
    <p>
      To solve an oblique triangle, we need to be given three pieces of information, which can take the following forms:
      <ol>
          <li>
              <p>One side and two angles.</p>
              <p>

      In this section, we explore techniques for solving triangles when provided with one side and two angles (ASA or SAA) and when given two sides along with the angle between them (SSA). Triangles falling under the categories of SAS and SSS will be discussed in more detail in the <xref ref="law_of_cosines"/>.

    <p>
      The <term>Law of Sines</term> states that for any triangle, the ratios of the lengths of the sides to the sine of their corresponding opposite angles are equal. When provided with certain information about the sides and angles of a triangle, this fundamental principle becomes a valuable tool for determining the remaining sides and angles.

        Using the right triangles, we have <m>\sin A=\frac{h}{b}</m> and <m>\sin B=\frac{h}{a}</m>. Solving both equations for <m>h</m>, we get <m>h=b\sin A</m> and <m>h=a\sin B</m>. Since these equations both equal <m>h</m>, we can now set them equal to each other.

          In this triangle, we know the values of two angles and the side between them, so we have an Angle-Side-Angle (ASA) triangle. We know that <m>A+B+C=180^{\circ}</m>. So <m>80^{\circ}+60^{\circ}+C=140^{\circ}+C=180^{\circ}</m> so <m>C=40^{\circ}</m>. To solve for <m>a</m>, we will use the Law of Sines. Either form for the Law of Sines can be used to solve this problem, but since we are solving for a side, it would be easier and require fewer steps if we use the second form for the Law of Sines.
          <md>
            <mrow>\frac{a}{\sin A}\amp =\amp \frac{c}{\sin C}</mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{a}{\sin 80^{\circ}}\amp =\amp \frac{1,000}{\sin 40^{\circ}}</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          Multiplying both sides by <m>\sin 80^{\circ}</m>,
          <me>
            a=\frac{1,000\sin 80^{\circ}}{\sin 40^{\circ}}\approx1,532\mbox{ ft}
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To solve for <m>b</m>, we have two options to use for the Law of Sines
          <me>
            \frac{b}{\sin B}=\frac{a}{\sin A}\qquad\mbox{or} \qquad\frac{b}{\sin B}=\frac{c}{\sin C}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Because our answer for <m>a</m> was rounded, using the first option may lead to rounding errors so it is best to use the second option because it has known values that we were originally given in the problem (<m>c=1,000</m>). Thus we will use
          <me>
            \frac{b}{\sin B}=\frac{c}{\sin C}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          So we get
          <me>

      Although the Law of Sines can be used to solve oblique triangles, there may be cases that would give us one triangle, two triangles, or even no solution. Such cases are known as the <em>ambiguous case</em>. This occurs when we know two sides and an angle that is opposite to one of the given sides.

        <p>
          Referring to <xref ref="tab_SSA">Table</xref>, our known angle (<m>A=27.4^{\circ}</m>) is acute, the side opposite of our angle (<m>a=5</m>) is greater than the side adjacent to the angle (<m>c=1</m>) so we have Case 4 and know that we have one triangle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using the first form of the Law of Sines
          <me>
            \frac{\sin A}{a}=\frac{\sin C}{c}
          </me>
          we get
          <me>
            \sin C=c\cdot\frac{\sin A}{a}\approx1\cdot\frac{\sin 27.4^{\circ}}{5}\approx0.092
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Taking the inverse sine we get
          <me>
            C=\sin^{-1}0.092\approx5.8^{\circ}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that we know the value of <m>C</m>, we will need to add that to the heading that we determined in the last section (<m>207.4^{\circ}</m>) to get <m>5.8^{\circ}+207.4^{\circ}=213.2^{\circ}</m>. Next we refer to the Star Compass with angles (<xref ref="star-compass-with-angles"/>) to conclude we will need to sail towards the House Noio Kona.

        <p>
          Here we have that <m>\sin B</m> is positive and we know that sine is positive in Quadrant I and II so our value for <m>B</m> may be between <m>0^{\circ}</m> and <m>180^{\circ}</m>. Taking the inverse sine we get our first angle

            B_1=\sin^{-1}(0.75)\approx48.58^{\circ}

          which is in Quadrant I. To calculate the angle in Quadrant II, we subtract the reference angle from <m>180^{\circ}</m> to get
          <me>
            B_2=180^{\circ}-B_1=180^{\circ}-48.58^{\circ}=131.42^{\circ}

    <proof>
      <p>
        Recall the area of any triangle is <m>\mbox{Area} =\frac{1}{2}bh</m> where <m>b</m> is the base and <m>h</m> is the height of a triangle. In a right triangle, the height is the length of one side. However, in an oblique triangle, the height is not immediately known.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the angle <m>C</m> is acute, then using the property that
        <me>
          \sin C=\frac{\mbox{opposite} }{\mbox{adjacent} }=\frac{h}{a}
        </me>
        the height is then given by
        <me>
          h=a\sin C
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        If the angle <m>C</m> is obtuse, then we use the reference angle for <m>C</m>, <m>180^{\circ}-C</m> to get
        <me>
          h=a\sin(180^{\circ}-C)
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        By the difference formula we get <m>\sin(180^{\circ}-C)=\sin C</m> and thus
        <me>
          h=a\sin C
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        In a right triangle, <m>C=90^{\circ}</m> and since <m>\sin90^{\circ}=1</m>, we can also write
        <me>
          h=a\sin C=a\sin90^{\circ}=a\cdot1=a
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus regardless of the triangle, we get
        <me>
          \mbox{Area} =\frac{1}{2}(\mbox{base} )(\mbox{height} )=\frac{1}{2}b(a\sin C)=\frac{1}{2}ab\sin C
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        The other formulas are obtained using a similar method.

          Using the formula, the area is

            \mbox{Area} =\frac{1}{2}ab\sin C=\frac{1}{2}(15)(18)\sin44^{\circ}\approx93.8\mbox{ft} ^2

          In Cook Island Maori mythology, Paikea was a skilled navigator, credited with leading his people safely across the ocean. In tuned with the natural world around him, Paikea turned to a whale who helped guide him and his people to the Cook Islands. The vaka motu Paikea, named after the navigator, 

          Recall the example from <xref ref="inverse_trigonometry"/> where Hinemoana is sailing to Rarotonga. We calculated that to sail from Aotearoa to Rarotonga, you would need to sail towards the house Manu Koʻolau (<m>41.8^{\circ}</m>). In reality, there are currents that push the waʻa off course. Now let's consider that a current of 2 knots is moving to the house Hikina (East). If we were to face Rarotonga and sail straight, the current put us to the east of our destination. To ensure we arrive at Rarotonga, our apparent heading will need to be a point to the west of our destination, as shown below.
        </p>
        <p>
          *(check the direction of the current in real life to make this more realistic)

          If we sail at 5 knots,
          what house will we need to face in order to compensate for the current of 2 knots?
          First notice that by alternate interior angles,
          we have that <m>B=41.8^{\circ}</m>.
          Now we will write the triangle where the sides represents the speed.
