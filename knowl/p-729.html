<p>Recall the example from <a href="Inverse_Trigonometry.html" class="internal" title="Section 2.4: Inverse Trigonometric Functions">Section 2.4</a> where Alingano Maisu is sailing to her new home in Satawal. For the first leg of the voyage, we calculated that to sail from Johnston Atoll to Majuro, you would need to sail towards the house House ʻĀina Kona (<span class="process-math">\(27.4^{\circ}\)</span>). In reality, there are currents that push the wa‘a off course. Now let’s consider that a current of 1 knot is flowing to the house Komohana (West). If we were to face Majuro and sail straight, the current put us to the west of our destination. To ensure we arrive at Majuro, our apparent heading will need to be a point to the west of our destination, as shown below.</p>
