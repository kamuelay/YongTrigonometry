<p>``Before GPS, the Long Range Navigation (LORAN) system was used to determine a ship's location. Two radio stations A and B simultaneously sent out a signal to a ship. The difference in time it took to receive the signal was computed as a distance locating the ship on the hyperbola with the A and B radio stations as the foci. A second pair of radio stations C and D sent simultaneous signals to the ship and computed its location on the hyperbola with C and D as the foci. The point P where the two hyperbolas intersected gave the location of the ship."</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="Hyperbolas.html#example-80" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
