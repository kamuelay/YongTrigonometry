<p>\Question Earth completes one rotation around the Sun approximately every 365.25 days. Assume the orbit is a circle and that the Earth is <span class="process-math">\(92.9\)</span> million miles from the Sun. \begin{tasks} \task How far does the Earth travel in one day, expressed as millions of miles? <em class="emphasis">Hint: First determine the angle or proportion of a rotation that Earth travels in one day, then calculate the arc length of Earth's orbit.</em> \task How for does the Earth travel in 30 days, expressed as millions of miles? \task How far does the Earth travel in one rotation, expressed as millions of miles? \task What is the linear speed of Earth as orbits the Sun? Express your answer in miles per hour. \end{tasks}</p>
