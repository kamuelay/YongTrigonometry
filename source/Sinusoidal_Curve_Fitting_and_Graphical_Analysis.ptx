  <title>Sinusoidal Curve Fitting and Graphical Analysis</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this chapter, we have learned that sinusoidal patterns exist in various aspects throughout our world. One example is the moon, which undergoes phases oscillating from no illumination, to waxing (increasing illumination), reaching a fully lit moon, and then waning (decreasing illumination) until it completes its cycle with no illumination again. Indigenous cultures across the world have deeply connected with these lunar cycles, shaping cultural practices aligned with the moon's phases. For example, the Māori of New Zealand and the Hopi Tribe in northeastern Arizona, USA, both time activities like planting and harvesting specific plants for each moon cycle based on generations of lunar observations.

      In Section 2.1 (graphs_of_the_sine_and_cosine_functions)
      *********
      , we graphed sinusoidal functions and determined their values at any given time. The ability to formulate a sinusoidal equation modeling the moon's phases allows us to predict the moon's phase on any date. In this section, we will explore the process of developing sinusoidal functions based on provided information. This will enable us to model real-world phenomena using real data.

      <title>Finding an Equation of a Sine Function Using its Characteristics</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Write an equation of a sine function with an amplitude of 2, period of 8, phase shift of <m>\frac{\pi}{3}</m>, and vertical shift of 4.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          To determine an equation of the form
          <me>
            f(x)=A\cdot\sin(B(x-C))+D
          </me>
          we first examine the information that we are given: amplitude of 2, period of 8, phase shift of <m>\frac{\pi}{3}</m>, and vertical shift of 4.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since <m>|A|</m> represents the value of the amplitude, we get
          <me>
            |A|=2
          </me>.
          Thus we either have <m>A=2</m> or <m>A=-2</m>. Since we are not given a reflection about the <m>x</m>-axis, we can conclude that <m>A</m> is not negative, thus
          <me>
            A=2
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, since the period of a sine function is given by <m>\frac{2\pi}{|B|}</m>, we get
          <me>
            \frac{2\pi}{|B|}=8
          </me>.
          Solving for <m>|B|</m>, we get
          <me>
            |B|=\frac{2\pi}{8}=\frac{\pi}{4}
          </me>
          Since there is no reflection about the <m>y</m>-axis, we have that <m>B</m> must be positive:
          <me>
            B=\frac{\pi}{4}.
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, since <m>C</m> and <m>D</m> represent the phase shift and vertical shift, respectively, we get
          <me>
            C=\frac{\pi}{3},\quad D=4
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Combining these, the sine function becomes:
          <me>
            f(x)=2\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\left(x-\frac{\pi}{3}\right)\right)+4
          </me>.

      Sometimes we are not explicitly given the characteristics of the function, but are provided with the graph. Examining a graph can reveal its characteristics, allowing us to find the equation of a function.

          Find an equation of the form <m>y = A\cos(B(x - C)) + D</m> that fits the graph.

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          <em>Amplitude (<m>A</m>)</em>: Since the amplitude of the cosine function will be the same as the amplitude of the sine function, which is 1, we have  <m>|A| = 1</m>. Therefore <m>A = 1</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Period (B)</em>: The period of the cosine function will also be the same as the period of the sine function, which is <m>2\pi</m>. Since <m>2\pi=\frac{2\pi}{|B|}</m>, we have <m>|B| = 1</m>, leading to <m>B = 1</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Vertical Shift (D)</em>: The vertical shift of the cosine function will be the same as that of the sine function, which is 0. So, we have <m>D = 0</m>.

          Therefore, we have

          Overlapping the graph of <m>y=\cos(x)</m> onto the original graph will help us determine the phase shift.

        </image>
        <p>
          <em>Phase Shift (C)</em>: From the graph, the cosine function will have a phase shift of <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m> radians to the right compared to the sine function. This is because the cosine function reaches its maximum value at <m>x = 0</m>, while the sine function reaches its maximum at <m>x = \frac{\pi}{2}</m>. So, we have <m>C = \frac{\pi}{2}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, the equation of the cosine function that fits the graph of <m>y = \sin(x)</m> is:
          <me>
            y = \cos\left(x - \frac{\pi}{2}\right)
          </me>
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <remark>
      <p>
        Since this graph is also the graph of <m>y=\sin(x)</m>, we get
        <me>
          \sin(x)=\cos\left(x-\frac{\pi}{2}\right)
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This solution demonstrates that any sine function can also be written as a cosine function, with an appropriate phase shift. In this case, the phase shift of <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m> radians to the right converts the sine function to its corresponding cosine function.

            that the amplitude is defined as half the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the function. Here, the maximum value is 16 and the minimum value is 0, so the amplitude is:

            We can see the midline is the horizontal line <m>y = 8</m>, and since the distance from the midline to both the maximum and minimum values is also 8, the amplitude is <m>|A| = 8</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Period (<m>B</m>)</em>: The period of a function is the length of one cycle. You can identify the period on the graph by measuring the horizontal distance between corresponding points where the graph completes a cycle. In this case, we'll use two corresponding peaks at <m>x = 10</m> and <m>x = 50</m> to obtain:
            <me>
              \mbox{period }=50-10=40.
            </me>
            Note that other points on the graph, such as the minimum values or where the graph crosses the midline, could also be used to determine the period.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since  
            *****
            <!-- <xref ref=""def-period""/> -->
            defines a period as <m>\frac{2\pi}{|B|}</m>, we have:
            <me>
              40=\frac{2\pi}{|B|}
            </me>
            Thus,
            <me>
              |B|=\frac{2\pi}{40}=\frac{\pi}{20}.

          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Phase Shift (<m>C</m>)</em>: The phase shift of the graph refers to its horizontal translation. The characteristics of a sine function typically start at <m>x = 0</m> on the midline, increase to the maximum, decrease, pass the midline to the minimum, and then complete a cycle back at the midline. Since this graph follows these characteristics without any horizontal translation, there is no phase shift. Therefore, <m>C = 0</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Vertical Shift (<m>D</m>)</em>: The midline at <m>y=8</m> represents the vertical shift of the graph and thus
            <me>D=8</me>.

            <em>Reflections</em>: Since this graph follows the characteristics of the sine function, there are no reflections about the <m>y</m>-axis, which means the amplitude <m>A</m> is positive. Similarly, there are no reflections about the <m>x</m>-axis, indicating that <m>B</m> is also positive. Therefore, we determine <m>A = 8</m> and <m>B = \frac{\pi}{20}</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, the graph can be described by the following sine function:
            <me>
              f(x)=8\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{20}x\right)+8

        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            <em>Amplitude (<m>A</m>)</em>: The amplitude of a cosine function is the same as that of the corresponding sine function. Thus, <m>|A| = 8</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Period (<m>B</m>)</em>: The period of a cosine function is also the same as that of the corresponding sine function. In this case, <m>|B| = \frac{\pi}{20}</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Vertical Shift (<m>D</m>)</em>: The vertical shift of a cosine function is the same as that of the corresponding sine function. Thus, <m>D = 8</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Reflections</em>: Similar to the sine function, this graph follows the characteristics of the cosine function. Thus, there are no reflections about the <m>y</m>-axis or the <m>x</m>-axis. Therefore, as with the sine function, we determine <m>A = 8</m> and <m>B = \frac{\pi}{20}</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before we examine the phase shift, let's summarize what we found so far:
            <me>
              g(x)=8\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{20}\left(x\right)\right)+8
            </me>
            and overlap this graph with the graph of the original.

            <em>Phase Shift (<m>C</m>)</em>: From the graph, we see that the starting point of the cosine function's cycle is at its maximum value, unlike the starting point of a sine function's cycle, which is at its midline. In this case, the graph has a horizontal shift to the right of 10 units. Thus, <m>C = 10</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We can now describe the graph with the following cosine function:
            <me>
              g(x)=8\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{20}\left(x-10\right)\right)+8
            </me>.

        </solution>
      </task>
    </example>
    <remark>
      <p>
        It's worth noting that while we used a reflection about the <m>x</m>-axis to determine the equation of the cosine function in this example, an alternative approach could have been to introduce a phase shift to the right. Since the maximum of the graph occurs halfway through the period of 29.53059 days, shifting the graph to the right by half of this period would give us another valid equation describing the same graph. In fact, there are infinitely many equations that can describe this graph, demonstrating the flexibility and variability of representing periodic functions.

      <statement>
        <p>
          According to the Astronomical Almanac, the average moon cycle is about 29.53059 days, that is, it takes approximately 29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes, and 2.9 seconds for the moon to complete its cycle. Across the Pacific, from Chamorro, to Samoan, to Māori, and Tahitian culture, traditional practices including navigation as well as planting and fishing are tied to the moon phases. Develop a cosine function of the form
          <me>
            f(x)=A\cos(B(x-C))+D
          </me>
          to determine the percent of the moon that is illuminated as a function of time, where Day 0, representing the start of the moon cycle is the new moon with <m>0\%</m> illuminated, increasing until <m>100\%</m> of the moon is illuminated, and then decreasing back to <m>0%</m> illuminated, completing the cycle after 29.53059 days. Using the function you developed, determine what percent of the moon is illuminated (rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent) on Day 100, that is 100 days after the initial new moon.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Analyzing the question, we see that a period, or cycle of the moon, is 29.53059 days. The function will range from 0% to 100% illumination, representing the minimum and maximum of the function, respectively. To visualize the function and determine its characteristics, we first sketch the function.

          From the definition of amplitude (
            ******
            <!-- <xref ref="def-amplitude"/> -->
            ),
          <me>
            |A|=\frac{100-0}{2}=50
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The characteristic of a cosine function is that at <m>x=0</m> the function is at its maximum value, before decreasing to its minimum value, and then back up to its maximum, completing one period. This curve, however, begins at its minimum value, increases to its maximum, before decreasing to its minimum. This change in pattern represents a reflection about the <m>x</m>-axis, thus the value for <m>A</m> is negative, giving us
          <me>
            A=-50
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, we know that the moon's cycle, or period is 29.53059 days. Therefore, we have
          <me>
            \frac{2\pi}{|B|}=29.53059
          </me>
          which leads to
          <me>
            |B|=\frac{2\pi}{29.53059}
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since there is no reflection about the y-axis, <m>B</m> is positive, resulting in
          <me>
            B=\frac{2\pi}{29.53059}
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is no phase shift (<m>C=0</m>) since the curve follows the characteristics of the cosine equation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The midline is at <m>50\%</m>, halfway between 0% and 100%, and representing a vertical shift of 50, so  <m>D=50</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, the equation of the function is
          <me>
            f(x)=-50\cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{29.53059}x\right)+50
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To determine the moon phase 100 days after the initial new moon, we evaluate our function at <m>x=100</m>:
          <me>
            f(100)=-50\cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{29.53059}\cdot100\right)+50=87.8\%
          </me>.

          we learned that Earth's axis is tilted and as the Earth orbits the sun, this axial tilt causes seasons, which is periodic. Another affect of the axial tilt and orbit is the amount of daylight each part of Earth experiences. Like the seasons, this is also periodic. 
        </p>
        <p>
          For each problem, the graphs of the total hours of daylight are provided
