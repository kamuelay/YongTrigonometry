  <title>The Law of Cosines</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      For generations, Micronesian navigators have been voyaging between low islands and atolls, traveling great distances without sighting land. This is accomplished using information on their speed and direction to form a mental map of where they are. When sailing, the navigator views the canoe as stationary and the islands as movable objects. Before they leave on their voyage, the navigator knows where they are relative to the islands between them and their destination. Not only this, they also know where where the relative position of the islands should be when they are at their destination. Once they begin their journey the navigator use the canoes Stationæry and the Islands are movable objects. When you begin, you can watch as you sail away from your origin, you can move the island behind you before it disappears over the horizon. When the island is no longer in site, you are still moving it as your voyage progresses, constantly evaluating where the canoe is as the other islands are moved. When the navigator has moved the other islands to their relative positions at the destination, the navigator will know their journey is complete, even before they sight land. This concept of moving islands is known as <term>etak</term><idx><h>etak</h></idx>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if the canoe travels from Poluwat to Guam, at the start, directly east in the house Wenenwenenup is Chuuk. However, the navigator will move Chuuk south until it is in the house Tolon Tumur, approximately <m>42.5^{\circ}</m> south of east. When Chuuk is moved to this position and the other islands are also moved to their respective positions, the navigator will know they have reached Guam. This process of moving islands is illustrated in <xref ref="video-etak"/>.

        In Micronesian navigation, the concept of <em>etak</em> is illustrated as islands appear to move relative to the stationary canoe. As the canoe journeys from Poluwat to Guam, Chuuk shifts from east to southeast, demonstrating the navigational perspective where islands are perceived to move while the canoe remains still.

      After sailing for 200 nautical miles, where would Chuuk (which originated due east of the canoe) have moved to relative to due east?

    <p>
      Since the line from Pulowat to Chuuk and the line due east of the canoeʻs current position are parallel (they both point due east), recall from geometry that alternate interior angles of parallel lines are equals. Thus, to find the angle of how far below east Chuuk now lies, it is equivalent to finding the angle formed from Pulowat to Chuuk to the canoe.

      This gives us a side-angle-side (SAS) triangle because two sides are known as well as the angle between them. Unfortunately, we cannot use the Law of Sines to solves this oblique triangle. Instead, in this section, we will learn about the Law of Cosines and how to use it to solve triangles that are SAS and SSS as well as calculating the areas of triangles, with only their sides given.
    </p>
    <p>
      This should go into the example solution, but to solve for the opposite side, call it d (label it in a new figure) we get
      <me>
        d^2=200^2+143^2-2\cdot200\cdot143\cos124.5^{\circ}
      </me>
      or
      <me>
        d=\sqrt{200^2+143^2-2\cdot200\cdot143\cos124.5^{\circ}}\approx304.71
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Then to find the angle <m>\theta</m> we can use the Law of Sines or Law of Cosines. We will choose the Law of Sines since it is simplier than the Law of Cosines will requires us to take the square root.
      <me>
        \frac{\sin124.5^{\circ}}{143}=\frac{\sin\theta}{200}
      </me>
      Solving for <m>\theta</m> we get
      <me>
        \theta=\sin^{-1}\left(200\cdot\frac{\sin124.5^{\circ}}{304.71}\right)\approx32.7^{\circ}

          Thus, in any triangle, the square of one side equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides, minus twice their product times the cosine of their included angle.

      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      Note: If the triangle is a right triangle, say <m>C=90^{\circ}</m>, then since <m>\cos90^{\circ}=0</m>, the Law of Cosines simplifies into the Pythagorean Theorem: <m>c^2=a^2+b^2</m>.

        To prove the first part, we will place a triangle with <m>A</m> at the origin and <m>C</m> on the <m>x</m>-axis, as shown below.

      <title>Using Law of Cosines (SAS): Fiji to Tonga</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The Fijian canoe Uto Ni Yalo is sailing from Fiji to Tonga. The navigators know Tonga is 412 NM from Fiji in the House Lā; Malanai (<m>16.81^{\circ}</m>). After sailing for one day and traveling 120 NM, the navigator determines they have gone off course by 2 houses (<m>22.5^{\circ}</m>). How far are they from Tonga and what is the angle that they will need to turn in order to reach their destination?

          This triangle, where we know two sides and the angle between them, is known as Side-Angle-Side (SAS). Unfortunately, the Law of Sines that we learned in <xref ref="law_of_sines"/> only applies to ASA, AAS, and SSA. In this section, we will learn how to solve SAS triangles as well as triangles where all three sides are known, called Side-Side-Side (SSS) triangles.

          How far are they from Tonga and what is the angle that they will need to turn in order to reach their destination?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The distance to Tonga can be found using the Law of Cosines
          <md>
            <mrow>a^2\amp =\amp b^2+c^2-2bc\cos A</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =\amp 412^2+120^2-2\cdot412\cdot120\cos22.5^{\circ}</mrow>

          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          Taking the square root of both sides we get
          <me>
            a\approx\sqrt{92,790.79}\approx304.62
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus they are approximately 305 NM from their destination.
        </p>
        <p>
          To determine the angle needed to adjust their course, we will first find <m>B</m> and subtract that from <m>180^{\circ}</m>. We can use either the Law of Sines or the Law of Cosines. If we use the Law of Sines
          <me>
            \frac{\sin A}{a}=\frac{\sin B}{b}
          </me>
          we know <m>a\approx304.62</m>, <m>b=412</m>, and <m>A=22.5^{\circ}</m>. Notice this is the case SSA for Law of Sines where we get two triangles. Since we already know what the triangle looks like, we want the measure for <m>B</m> that makes it obtuse. However, to avoid this ambiguous case, we can simply use the Law of Cosines
          <me>
            b^2=a^2+c^2-2ac\cos B
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Rearranging we have
          <me>
            \cos B=\frac{a^2+c^2-b^2}{2ac}\approx\frac{304.62^2+120^2-412^2}{2\cdot304.62\cdot120}\approx-0.8556
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          So,
          <me>
            B\approx\cos^{-1}(-0.8556)\approx148.83^{\circ}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus the angle Uto Ni Yalo needs to turn to adjust its course is <m>180^{\circ}-148.83^{\circ}=31.17^{\circ}</m> to the left.

          To find <m>A</m>, we begin by using the Law of Cosines:

            a^2=b^2+c^2-2ab\cos A

            \cos A=\frac{b^2+c^2-a^2}{2bc}=\frac{7^2+3^2-5^2}{2\cdot7\cdot3}=\frac{33}{42}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Taking the inverse cosine we get
          <me>
            A=\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{33}{42}\right)\approx38.2^{\circ}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          To find <m>B</m>, we continue with the Law of Cosines to get:
          <me>
            \cos B=\frac{a^2+c^2-b^2}{2ac}=\frac{5^2+3^2-7^2}{2\cdot5\cdot3}=-\frac{15}{30}=-\frac{1}{2}

          Taking the inverse cosine we get

            B=\cos^{-1}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)=120^{\circ}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          To find the last angle, <m>C</m>, we can use the fact that the angles in a triangle sum to <m>180^{\circ}</m>:
          <me>
            C=180^{\circ}-A-B\approx180^{\circ}-38.2^{\circ}-120^{\circ}=21.8^{\circ}

      </solution>
    </example>
    <remark>
      <p>
        Why we should not use Law of Sines to find B (or whatever you decide to be the second angle). The reason is we would have the ambiguous case SSA. Can use Law of Sines, just need to be careful since you wonʻt know which quadrant you should be in.

      Discuss why when solving SSS then second angle should be solved using Law of Cosines again instead of Law of Sines because of the potential for the angle being greater than 90 degrees. This is the ambiguous case.

    <title>Area of an oblique triangle</title>
    <p>
      The Greek mathematician, Heron of Alexandria, derived a formula for the area of a triangle when all three sides are given. Although a more modern derivation for this formula involves the Law of Cosines, it is still known as Heron's Formula.

      <title>Polynesian Triangle</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The Polynesian Triangle is an area in the Pacific Ocean consisting of over 1,000 islands. These islands are collectively known as Polynesia. The northern corner of the Polynesian Triangle is made up of the Hawaiian Islands, the southwestern corner is made up of Aotearoa, and the southeastern corner is made up with Rapa Nui. It is believed that the first inhabitants to the islands arrived at Ka Lae, Hawai`i; Hokianga, Aotearoa; and Anakena, Rapa Nui, respectively. The distance between Ka Lae, Hawai`i and Hokianga, Aotearoa is 4,250 miles, the distance between Hokianga, Aotearoa and Anakena, Rapa Nui is 4,500 miles, and the distance between Rapa Nui and Ka Lae, Hawai`i is 4,450 miles. What is the area of the Polynesian Triangle rounded to the nearest square mile?

      <solution>
        <p>
          Using Heron's Formula, we begin by calculating the semiperimeter
          <me>
            s=\frac{1}{2}(4,250+4,500+4,450)=6,600

        <p>
          Then the area created by the Polynesian Triangle is
          <me>
            \mbox{Area} =\sqrt{6,600(6,600-4,250)(6,600-4,500)(6,600-4,450)}\approx8,368,253\mbox{mi} ^2
