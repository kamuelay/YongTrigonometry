</h4>
<p>As Hōkūle‘a is sailing towards Rapa Nui, the navigator uses a process called dead reckoning to determine their position based on the latitude, measured by the stars, and other factors such as the estimated distance traveled, speed, and direction. Once the navigator has determined they are in the vicinity of land, her attention is now focused on looking for signs of land. One method navigators will use is to look for land-based seabirds such as the manu-o-kū (fairy tern) and the noio (noddy tern), which go out to sea in the morning to fish and return to land at night. However, Rapa Nui’s seabird population has been reduced so she will look for other signs such as drifting land vegetation; clouds that form over islands; the loom of the island when white sand and still lagoons reflect the sun or moon upwards; and distinctive patterns of swells bending (refracting) around and / or reflecting off islands. Land will be spotted when the navigator first sees Maunga Terevaka, the tallest point in Rapa Nui, which stands at 1,665 ft.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>On the deck of Hōkūleʻa, a navigator stands at 9 ft above sea level. If she looks out to the sea, how far is she from horizon? Assume the radius of the earth at Rapa Nui is 3,960.449 miles.</p></li>
<li><p>How far is Hōkūleʻa from Maunga Terevaka when it first becomes visible over the horizon to someone standing 9ft above sea level?</p></li>
