<p>The Hawai`iloa is a double-hulled voyaging canoe whose construction was intended to recover knowledge and skills associated with traditional Hawaiian canoe-building with native materials. A major problem arose in 1989-1990 when it was determined that the koa forests in Hawai`i no longer had trees large enough to construct such a canoe so the search had to be extended beyond Hawai‘i. Using trees that didn’t originate in Hawai`i still followed the theme of using traditional materials because during storms, large trees from the Pacific Coast of North American have been known to have been swept into the Pacific Ocean and float to islands such as Hawai`i. Such trees have traditionally been used for canoe building across the Pacific. Two trees, each 200 feet high and over 400 years old were located in Shelikof Island in Soda Bay, Prince of Wales Island, west of Ketchikan, Alaska. Traditional Hawaiian and Tlingit tree cutting ceremonies were then performed to ask permission to take the trees to build a waʻa. The trees were then cut and the logs shipped to Hawai`i. The path of these logs from Alaska to Hawai`i is known as a <dfn class="terminology">vector</dfn>,  because it has both a length and a direction. We represent a vector with an arrow to indicate its <dfn class="terminology">direction</dfn>.  The length of the arrow represents the <dfn class="terminology">magnitude</dfn>  of the vector. See <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_Juneau-to-Honolulu.html" title="Figure 4.3.1">Figure 4.3.1</a>. Many things in physics can be represented with vectors.</p>
