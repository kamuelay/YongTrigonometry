<p>Hyperbolas have many applications. When a jet flies at a speed greater than the speed of sound, the shock wave that is created is heard as a sonic boom. The wave has the shape of a cone. The shape formed as the cone hits the ground is one branch of a hyperbola. Halley's Comet, a permanent part of our solar system, travels around the sun in an elliptical orbit. Other comets pass through the solar system only once, following a hyperbolic path with the sun as a focus.</p>
<p>Hyperbolas are of practical importance in fields ranging from architecture to navigation. Cooling towers used in the design for nuclear power plants have cross sections that are both ellipses and hyperbolas. Three-dimensional solids whose cross sections are hyperbolas are used in some rather unique architectural creations, including the TWA building at Kennedy Airport in New York City and the St. Louis Science Center Planetarium.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="Hyperbolas.html#example-81" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
