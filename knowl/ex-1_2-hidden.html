<p>\Question At the start of this section you learned that the <em class="emphasis">latitude</em>  of a place is the angle between a line drawn from the center of the earth to that point and the equatorial plane. If the radius of the earth is 3,959 miles, calculate the arc length, <span class="process-math">\(s\text{,}\)</span> along the surface of the earth for \begin{tasks}(2) \task <span class="process-math">\(1^{\circ}\)</span> of latitude (in miles, rounded to 2 decimals) \task <span class="process-math">\(1'\)</span> of latitude (in miles, rounded to 2 decimals). \task <span class="process-math">\(1''\)</span> of latitude (in feet, rounded to the nearest integer) \end{tasks} A <em class="emphasis">nautical mile</em>,  frequently used in navigation, is slightly longer than a mile on land. One nautical mile was historically defined to be the arc length corresponding to one minute of latitude. Check your answer in (b) with the value of one nautical mile.</p>

<p>\Question The <em class="emphasis">oeoe</em>, or Hawaiian bullroarer, is made by drilling holes into a kamani seed or coconut shell, then threading a long string through the holes to securing it. When the oeoe is swung by the string, a whistling sound is produced, similar to the sound of the wind on the top of mountains. If a girl is swinging an oeoe at the end of 3 foot long rope at a rate of 180 revolutions per minute, calculate 1) the angular speed measured in radians per minute; 2) the linear speed of the shell in miles per hour (round to two decimal places).</p>
<p>\Question Earth completes one rotation around the Sun approximately every 365.25 days. Assume the orbit is a circle and that the Earth is <span class="process-math">\(92.9\)</span> million miles from the Sun. \begin{tasks} \task How far does the Earth travel in one day, expressed as millions of miles? <em class="emphasis">Hint: First determine the angle or proportion of a rotation that Earth travels in one day, then calculate the arc length of Earth's orbit.</em> \task How for does the Earth travel in 30 days, expressed as millions of miles? \task How far does the Earth travel in one rotation, expressed as millions of miles? \task What is the linear speed of Earth as orbits the Sun?

<p>\Question As the the moon orbits the Earth, different parts of its surface become illuminated by the Sun which we call moon phases.  The moon completes one rotation about Earth in approximately 27.3 days. If we assume its orbit is circular and the moon is 239,000 miles from Earth, calculate the linear speed of the moon, expressed as miles per hour.</p>
<p>\Question At <span class="process-math">\(17.7^{\circ}\)</span> S latitude, the city of Nadi, Fiji is <span class="process-math">\(6,071\)</span> km from the Earth's axis of rotation (see <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ex-1_2.html" title="Checkpoint 1.2.28">Exercise 1.2.28</a>, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">[cross-reference to target(s) "Earth_Angular_Velocity" missing or not unique]</code>). In 24 hours, Nadi will have traveled one rotation around Earth or <span class="process-math">\(2\pi(6, 071)\)</span> km. The city of Port Vila, Vanuatu lies 967 km directly to the west of Nadi, Fiji. As the Earth rotates, how many minutes sooner will the people of Nadi see the Sun rise than the people in Port Vila, rounded to one decimal? <em class="emphasis">Hint: the proportion of distance between the two cities to the distance traveled in one rotation is the same as the proportion of the time it takes to see the sun between the two cities to time it takes to complete one rotation.</em></p></article></body>
