<p>Hyperbolas have many applications. When a jet flies at a speed greater than the speed of sound, the shock wave that is created is heard as a sonic boom. The wave has the shape of a cone. The shape formed as the cone hits the ground is one branch of a hyperbola. Halley's Comet, a permanent part of our solar system, travels around the sun in an elliptical orbit. Other comets pass through the solar system only once, following a hyperbolic path with the sun as a focus.</p>
