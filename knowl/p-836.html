<p>If a waʻa sails for two days at 5 knots, it will have covered 240 miles. This distance traveled is known as the magnitude of the vector and it is given as a real number. These real numbers are often referred to as <dfn class="terminology">scalars</dfn>.  The magnitude of the vector that represents a wa‘a’s path for two days will be twice as big as the magnitude of the vector that represents the path a waʻa sailed for only one day. We now can define how we multiply a vector by a scalar.</p>
