  <title>Sinusoidal Curve Fitting and Graphical Analysis</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this chapter, we have learned that sinusoidal patterns exist in various aspects throughout our world. One example is the moon, which undergoes phases oscillating from no illumination, to waxing (increasing illumination), reaching a fully lit moon, and then waning (decreasing illumination) until it completes its cycle with no illumination again. Indigenous cultures across the world have deeply connected with these lunar cycles, shaping cultural practices aligned with the moon's phases. For example, the MƒÅori of New Zealand and the Hopi Tribe in northeastern Arizona, USA, both time activities like planting and harvesting specific plants for each moon cycle based on generations of lunar observations.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Section 2.1 (graphs_of_the_sine_and_cosine_functions), we graphed sinusoidal functions and determined their values at any given time. The ability to formulate a sinusoidal equation modeling the moon's phases allows us to predict the moon's phase on any date. In this section, we will explore the process of developing sinusoidal functions based on provided information. This will enable us to model real-world phenomena using real data.

      <title>Finding an Equation of a Sine Function Using its Characteristics</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Write an equation of a sine function with an amplitude of 2, period of 8, phase shift of <m>\frac{\pi}{3}</m>, and vertical shift of 4.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          To determine an equation of the form
          <me>
            f(x)=A\cdot\sin(B(x-C))+D
          </me>
          we first examine the information that we are given: amplitude of 2, period of 8, phase shift of <m>\frac{\pi}{3}</m>, and vertical shift of 4.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since <m>|A|</m> represents the value of the amplitude, we get
          <me>
            |A|=2
          </me>.
          Thus we either have <m>A=2</m> or <m>A=-2</m>. Since we are not given a reflection about the <m>x</m>-axis, we can conclude that <m>A</m> is not negative, thus
          <me>
            A=2
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, since the period of a sine function is given by <m>\frac{2\pi}{|B|}</m>, we get
          <me>
            \frac{2\pi}{|B|}=8
          </me>.
          Solving for <m>|B|</m>, we get
          <me>
            |B|=\frac{2\pi}{8}=\frac{\pi}{4}
          </me>
          Since there is no reflection about the <m>y</m>-axis, we have that <m>B</m> must be positive:
          <me>
            B=\frac{\pi}{4}.
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, since <m>C</m> and <m>D</m> represent the phase shift and vertical shift, respectively, we get
          <me>
            C=\frac{\pi}{3},\quad D=4
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Combining these, the sine function is:
          <me>
            f(x)=2\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\left(x-\frac{\pi}{3}\right)\right)+4
          </me>.
        </p>

            <em>Amplitude (<m>A</m>)</em>: Recall from Definition "def-amplitude" that the amplitude is defined as half the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the function. Here, the maximum value is 16 and the minimum value is 0, so the amplitude is:
            <me>|A| = \frac{16 - 0}{2} = 8.</me>

            </latex-image>
          </image>
          <p>
            We can see the midline is the horizontal line <m>y = 8</m>, and since the distance from the midline to both the maximum and minimum values is also 8, the amplitude is <m>|A| = 8</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Period (<m>B</m>)</em>: The period of a function is the length of one cycle. You can identify the period on the graph by measuring the horizontal distance between corresponding points where the graph completes a cycle. In this case, we'll use two corresponding peaks at <m>x = 10</m> and <m>x = 50</m> to obtain:
            <me>
              \mbox{period }=50-10=40.
            </me>
            Note that other points on the graph, such as the minimum values or where the graph crosses the midline, could also be used to determine the period.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since Definition "def-period" defines a period as <m>\frac{2\pi}{|B|}</m>, we have:
            <me>
              40=\frac{2\pi}{|B|}
            </me>
            Thus,
            <me>
              |B|=\frac{2\pi}{40}=\frac{\pi}{20}.
            </me>
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Phase Shift (<m>C</m>)</em>: The phase shift of the graph refers to its horizontal translation. The characteristics of a sine function typically start at <m>x = 0</m> on the midline, increase to the maximum, decrease, pass the midline to the minimum, and then complete a cycle back at the midline. Since this graph follows these characteristics without any horizontal translation, there is no phase shift. Therefore, <m>C = 0</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Vertical Shift (<m>D</m>)</em>: The midline at <m>y=8</m> represents the vertical shift of the graph and thus
            <me>D=8</me>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Reflections</em>: Since this graph follows the characteristics of the sine function, there are no reflections about the <m>y</m>-axis, which means the amplitude <m>A</m> is positive. Similarly, there are no reflections about the <m>x</m>-axis, indicating that <m>B</m> is also positive. Therefore, we determine <m>A = 8</m> and <m>B = \frac{\pi}{20}</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, the graph can be described by the following sine function:
            <me>
              y=8\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{20}x\right)+8
            </me>

      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>

          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            <em>Amplitude (<m>A</m>)</em>: The amplitude of a cosine function is the same as that of the corresponding sine function. Thus, <m>|A| = 8</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Period (<m>B</m>)</em>: The period of a cosine function is also the same as that of the corresponding sine function. In this case, <m>|B| = \frac{\pi}{20}</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Phase Shift (<m>C</m>)</em>: The phase shift of a cosine function refers to its horizontal translation, similar to that of a sine function. However, the starting point of a cosine function's cycle is at its maximum value, unlike the starting point of a sine function's cycle, which is at its midline. Therefore, the phase shift for the cosine function might differ from that of the sine function. In this case, the graph has a horizontal shift to the right of 10 units. Thus, <m>C = 10</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Vertical Shift (<m>D</m>)</em>: The vertical shift of a cosine function is the same as that of the corresponding sine function. Thus, <m>D = 8</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Reflections</em>: Similar to the sine function, this graph follows the characteristics of the cosine function. Thus, there are no reflections about the <m>y</m>-axis or the <m>x</m>-axis. Therefore, as with the sine function, we determine <m>A = 8</m> and <m>B = \frac{\pi}{20}</m>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, the graph can be described by the following cosine function:
            <me>
              y=8\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{20}\left(x-10\right)\right)+8
            </me>
          </p>
        </solution>
      </task>

      <title>Modeling the Moon Cycles</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          According to the Astronomical Almanac, the average moon cycle is about 29.53059 days, that is, it takes approximately 29 days, 12 hours, 44 minutes, and 2.9 seconds for the moon to complete its cycle. Across the Pacific, from Chamorro, to Samoan, to MƒÅori, and Tahitian culture, traditional practices including navigation as well as planting and fishing are tied to the moon phases. Develop a cosine function of the form
          <me>
            f(x)=A\cos(B(x-C))+D
          </me>
          to determine the percent of the moon that is illuminated as a function of time, where Day 0, representing the start of the moon cycle is the new moon with <m>0\%</m> illuminated, increasing until <m>100\%</m> of the moon is illuminated, and then decreasing back to <m>0%</m> illuminated, completing the cycle after 29.53059 days. Using the function you developed, determine what percent of the moon is illuminated (rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent) on Day 100, that is 100 days after the initial new moon.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Analyzing the question we see that a period, or cycle of the moon is 29.53059 days. We also have that the function will range from <m>0\%</m> to <m>100\%</m> illumination, representing the minimum and maximum of the functions. With this information, we will first sketch the function to help us visualize the function, and determine its characteristics.

          The characteristic of a cosine function is that at <m>x=0</m> the function is at its maximum value, before decreasing to its minimum value, and then back up to its maximum, completing one period. This curve, however, begins at its minimum value, increases to its maximum, before decreasing to its minimum. This change in pattern represents a reflection about the <m>x</m>-axis.
          
          at Next we will determine if we will use a sine or cosine function
        </p>
        <p>
          To determine an equation of the form
          <me>
            f(x)=A\cdot\cos(B(x-C))+D
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          To model the moon cycle, we want the function to range from <m>0\%</m> illuminated to <m>100\%</m>, representing the minimum and maximum values of the function, respectively. From (Definition 2.1.24), the amplitude, <m>|A|</m> is half the distance between its maximum and minimum values:
          <me>
            |A|=\frac{100-0}{2}=50
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, we also have that the midline is at <m>50\%</m>, representing a vertical shift of <m>D=50</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, we know that the moon ªs cycle, or period is 29.53059 days. Therefore, we have
          <me>
            \frac{2\pi}{|B|}=29.53059
          </me>.
        </p>
        

        <p>
          We get our answer
          <me>
            f(x)=50\cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{29.53059}x\right)+50
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To determine the moon phase 100 days after the initial new moon, we evaluate our function at <m>x=100</m>:
          <me>
            f(100)=50\cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{29.53059}\cdot100\right)+50=87.8\%
          </me>.

    <title>Finding Sinusoidal Equations from Data</title>
    <p>
      As we have seen in this chapter, many things in our world follow a sinusoidal pattern. One such thing is the moon, whose phases which oscilate from no illumination of the moon to waxing, or increasing illumination, until a fully lit moon, and then waning, or decreasing illumination until it completes its cycle with no illumination. Throughout the world, many Indigenous cultures have observed the moon ªs cycles, and through careful observations, have developed cultural practices based on the moon cycle. These observations inform people which day of the moon cycle is better for planting or harvesting, and which plants. (can you give an example). In Section 2.1, we graphed sinusoidal functions and determined the value of the function at any time. If we can develop a sinusoidal equation that models the phases of the moon, we can then predict the moon phase at any date. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In this section, we will develop sinusoidal functions based off given information. We can then use these functions to model phenomena in the world around us with real data.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Sections 2.1 we learned that Earth's axis is tilted and as the Earth orbits the sun, this axial tilt causes seasons, which is periodic. Another affect of the axial tilt and orbit is the amount of daylight each part of Earth experiences. Like the seasons, this is also periodic. 
       we graphed sinusoidal functions and transformations of their functions.

      Find the equation for the time that Makalii (Pleiades) emerges over the horizon over time throughout the year.
      Talk about the importance of this and how when it rises at sunset,
      it coincides with the start of Makahiki season.
      Then using an example that we already worked with the sun and the time the sun sets over the year,
      find the intersection of these two equations to determine when Makahiki season will begin.
