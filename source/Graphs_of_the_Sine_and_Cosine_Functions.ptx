      The seasons on Earth are caused by axial tilt.
      To visual axial tilt,
      image a pole through the center of Earth and extending through the North and South Pole with Earth spinning around this pole.
      Each spin is one day.
      As the Earth revolves around the sun,
      the North Pole tilts towards the sun and sometimes the South Pole tilts towards the sun,
      this tilting is call <em>axial tilt</em>.
          <idx><h>Axial Tilt</h></idx>
      When the North Pole is closer to the Sun
      (the South Pole is away from the Sun),
      the Northern Hemisphere experiences summer
      (the Southern Hemisphere experiences winter).
      When the axial tilt is reversed and the North Pole is further from the Sun (South Pole is close to the Sun),
      the seasons are reversed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every day as the Earth spins on its axis,
      the Sun rises from the eastern horizon.
      However, only twice a year will the sun rise due east,
      in the house Hikina.
      One occurrence is during the spring equinox.
      In the northern hemisphere, as spring turns into summer,
      the position the sun rises from will slowly move north,
      until the summer solstice,
      when the sun will rise from the most northern point
      (<m>23.44^{\circ}</m> or the house `\=Aina Ko`olau).
      After this, the position of the rising sun will move south until the fall equinox where the sun will once again rise from due east or Hikina,
      before continuing its southern movement until the winter solstice when the sun will rise from its southern most position
      (<m>-23.44^{\circ}</m> or the house `\=Aina Malanai).
      As winter turns to spring,
      the sun rise will start to move north until the next spring equinox where the position of the sun rise will once again be due east (Hikina).
      This process takes one year before it repeats itself year after year.
      This pattern of the position of the sun rise is a periodic function.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun's <em>declination</em>
          <idx><h>Declination</h></idx>
      is the angle between the equator and a line from the center of Earth to the sun.

      In <xref ref="Trigonometry">Chapter</xref>
      we learned about the six trigonometric functions.
      In this section we will study the graphs of the sine and cosine functions to help us understand their use in modeling physical phenomena.
      We will study the graphs of the remaining trigonometric functions in <xref ref="Graphs_of_Other_Trigonometric_Functions">Section</xref>.

    <p>
      Division is not required for the trigonometric functions <m>\sin\theta</m> and
      <m>\cos\theta</m> and so we do not need to worry about dividing by zero,
      thus <m>\theta</m> can be any angle.
      In other words, the domains for <m>\sin\theta</m> and
      <m>\cos\theta</m> consist of the set of all real numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, looking at <m>\tan\theta</m> and <m>\sec\theta</m>,
      you may notice there is division by <m>x</m>.
      We run into problems when <m>x=0</m> because it would result in dividing by 0.
      These are the points when the terminal side of <m>\theta</m> lies on the <m>y</m>-axis.
      On the unit circle, the points are <m>(0,1)</m> and <m>(0,-1)</m>.
      These points correspond to the angles <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m> and
      <m>\frac{3\pi}{2}</m> (<m>90^{\circ}</m> and <m>270^{\circ}</m>),
      as well as all their coterminal angles:
      <m>\ldots, -\frac{3\pi}{2}, \frac{-\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{3\pi}{2}, \frac{5\pi}{2}, \ldots</m>
      (<m>\ldots, -270^{\circ}, -90^{\circ}, 90^{\circ}, 270^{\circ}, 450^{\circ}, \ldots</m>).
      In general, any angle of the form
      <m>\frac{\pi}{2}+n\pi</m> (<m>90^{\circ}+180^{\circ}\cdot n</m>) for some integer <m>n</m> should be excluded from the domain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, we run into problems for <m>\csc\theta</m> and
      <m>\cot\theta</m> when <m>y=0</m> since we would divide by 0.
      This corresponds to when the terminal side of <m>\theta</m> lies on the <m>x</m>-axis.
      These points on the unit circle are <m>(1,0)</m> and <m>(-1,0)</m> and have corresponding angles <m>0</m> and <m>\pi</m>,
      as well as all their coterminal angles:
      <m>\ldots, -2\pi, -\pi, 0, \pi, 2\pi, \ldots</m>
      (<m>\ldots, -360^{\circ}, -180^{\circ}, 0^{\circ}, 180^{\circ}, 360^{\circ}, \ldots</m>).
      In general, any angle of the form
      <m>\pi\cdot n</m> (<m>180^{\circ}\cdot n</m>) for some integer <m>n</m> should be excluded from the domain.

      Next we look at the range for each of the trigonometric functions.
      If <m>P(x,y)</m> is a point on the unit circle,
      then we have <m>-1\leq x\leq1</m> and <m>-1\leq y\le1</m>.
      Since <m>\sin\theta=y</m> and <m>\cos\theta=x</m>,
      it follows that <m>-1\leq\sin\theta\leq1</m> and <m>-1\leq\cos\theta\leq1</m>.
