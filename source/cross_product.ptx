    For vector spaces, and only for vector spaces,
    there is a second way to define a product of two vectors.
    In this section,
    we will discuss the cross-product of vectors which will allow us to find a vector that is perpendicular to the two given vectors.

    <statement>

        If <m>\mathbf{u}=\langle a_1,a_2,a_3\rangle</m> and
        <m>\mathbf{v}=\langle b_1,b_2,b_3\rangle</m> are three-dimensional vectors,
        then the <term>cross product</term>
            <idx><h>cross product</h></idx>
        of <m>\mathbf{u}</m> and <m>\mathbf{v}</m> is defined to be the vector
        <me>
          \mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{v}=\langle a_2b_3-a_3b_2,a_3b_1-a_1b_3,a_1b_2-a_2b_1\rangle

    Example: A boat is sailing on a bearing of
    <m>89^{\circ}</m> east of north at 564 feet per min.
    A tail wind is adding to the plane's velocity and blowing
    <m>78^{\circ}</m> west of north at 25 feet per min.
    Determine the actual speed of the plane in mph.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ans: The boat is moving at 540 feet per min = 6.14mph

    Let's revisit our sailing ship.
    We have a vector for the direction of the mast M, going straight up (0,1,0),
    and the direction of the north-north-east wind W (1,0,2),
    and we want to find the direction the sail S should stick out in order to best catch the wind.
    The sail has to be perpendicular to the mast,
    and also perpendicular to the wind.
    To solve this, we can use the cross product: S = M x W.
  </p>
  <p>
    The cross product of A(a1,a2,a3)) and B(b1,b2,b3)) is:
  </p>
  <p>
    (a2b3-a3b2, a3b1-a1b3, a1b2-a2b1) So now we can plug in our numbers and solve our problem:
  </p>
  <p>
    S = MxW = (0,1,0)x(1,0,2) = ([1*2-0*0], [0*1-0*2], [0*0-1*1]) = (2,0,-1)
