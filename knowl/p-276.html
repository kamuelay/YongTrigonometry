<p>\Question <em class="emphasis">Movement of Sand</em> The position of sand on a beach is constantly changing. One of the ways sand moves is through waves. In general, waves aren't perpendicular to the shore, instead they come at an angle. When the wave crashes on the shore in a process known as <em class="emphasis">swash</em>,  water as well as sediment move onto the beach as the same angle of the wave. Gravity takes over and the water and sediment run straight into the ocean (perpendicular to the shoreline), a process known as <em class="emphasis">backwash</em>.  This zig-zag motion of sand via the swash/backwash is called <em class="emphasis">longshore drift</em>.  Some beaches experience seasonal changes were waves come from a single direction in one season but come from the other direction in the next season while other beaches where waves predominantly come from a single direction will have other sand pile up at one.</p>
