      (<em>pinching</em> if you steer the wa<sq>a at too small of an angle at the upcoming wind,
      you will point in the upwind direction but go slow,
      <em>footing</em> if you move at a too large of an angle then you will move fast but won</sq>t make much upwind progress.

      A voyage undertaken using modern wayfinding must design a course strategy,
      which includes a reference course for reaching the vicinity of one's destination,
      hopefully upwind,
      so that the canoe can sail downwind to the destination rather than having to tack into the wind to get there.
      (Tacking involves sailing back and forth as closely as possible into the wind to make progress against the wind;
      it's very arduous and time-consuming,
      something to be avoided if at all possible,
      particularly at the end of a long, difficult voyage.)

    </p>
    <p>
      <q>Before a voyage by sail begins,
      the wayfinder designs a course strategy and reference course for reaching the destination from the departure point,
      given the capabilities of the vessel and the winds, currents,
      and weather conditions anticipated along the way. (See ``Winds, Weather,
      and Currents of the Pacific.</q>
      ) The course strategy represents the most efficient way of getting to the destination.
      The wayfinder also chooses the best time to go
      (when the wind and weather conditions are the most favorable),
      taking into account the timing of the return voyage as well."

      ``Sailing vessels like Hokuleâ€˜a cannot sail directly in the direction of the wind.
      If it needs to head toward the direction from which the wind is blowing,
      a vessel will sail off to the side,
      while remaining as close as possible to the wind direction (i.e., close-hauled),
      then change tacks to the other side,
      making forward progress in a tedious zigzagging pattern known as tacking:"

      Another example of tacking is when Hokulea is sailing to Rapa Nui.
      When it is When Hokulea is about 300 miles west of Rapa Nui , the navigators will begin a series of close tacks between <m>25^{\circ}</m> S and
      <m>29^{\circ}</m> S to search for the island;
      they will have to pass within about 30 miles of the island in daylight to see it from the canoe.

      May also consider adding/subtracting vectors for True wind velocity, Boat velocity,
      and Apparent wind velocity.
      Add this to the 8.1 sections or as a problem.

    <title>The Dot Product of Two Vectors</title>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          If <m>\mathbf{u}=\langle u_1,u_2\rangle</m> and <m>\mathbf{v}=\langle v_1,v_2\rangle</m> are vectors,
          then their <term>dot product</term>,
              <idx><h>dot product</h></idx>
          written <m>\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{v}</m> is defined as
          <me>
            \mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{v}=u_1v_1+u_2v_2
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          In other words,
          we compute the dot product by multiplying the corresponding components of the two vectors and adding the results.
          Note: The dot product is <term>not</term> a vector,
          but instead is a real number (a scalar)

          Here we calculate some dot products.

      <m>\mathbf{v}</m>,
      and <m>\mathbf{w}</m> be vectors and let <m>c</m> be a scalar
      (real number).
      Then
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{v}=\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{u}</m>

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>c(\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{v})=(c\mathbf{u})\cdot\mathbf{v}=\mathbf{u}\cdot(c\mathbf{v})</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>(\mathbf{u}+\mathbf{v})\cdot\mathbf{w}=\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{w}+\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{w}</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{u}=\|\mathbf{u}\|^2</m>

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\mathbf{0}\cdot\mathbf{v}=0</m>
