<p>Also recall (from Unit 1) that for a function, <span class="process-math">\(f\text{,}\)</span> to have an inverse, <span class="process-math">\(f^{-1}\text{,}\)</span> it must be one-to-one, meaning no horizontal line intersects the graph more than once. Since this is not true for trigonometric functions, they do not have inverses. We need functions to be one-to-one because both <span class="process-math">\(\sin\frac{\pi}{4}=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\sin\frac{3\pi}{4}=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\)</span> but if we took the inverse of sine, would we wouldn't know to use <span class="process-math">\(\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)=\frac{\pi}{4}\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)=\frac{3\pi}{4}\text{.}\)</span> To avoid this confusion and to ensure the function is one-to-one, we can put restrictions on the domains of each trigonometric function so they attain all the values in the range only once, making the function one-to-one, and thus have an inverse (see <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig_sine-not-one-to-one.html" title="Figure 2.4.1">FigureÂ 2.4.1</a>).</p>
