        ``Before GPS, the Long Range Navigation (LORAN) system was used to determine a ship's location.
        Two radio stations A and B simultaneously sent out a signal to a ship.
        The difference in time it took to receive the signal was computed as a distance locating the ship on the hyperbola with the A and B radio stations as the foci.
        A second pair of radio stations C and D sent simultaneous signals to the ship and computed its location on the hyperbola with C and D as the foci.
        The point P where the two hyperbolas intersected gave the location of the ship."

        Hyperbolas have many applications.
        When a jet flies at a speed greater than the speed of sound,
        the shock wave that is created is heard as a sonic boom.
        The wave has the shape of a cone.
        The shape formed as the cone hits the ground is one branch of a hyperbola.
        Halley's Comet, a permanent part of our solar system,
        travels around the sun in an elliptical orbit.
        Other comets pass through the solar system only once,
        following a hyperbolic path with the sun as a focus.

        Hyperbolas are of practical importance in fields ranging from architecture to navigation.
        Cooling towers used in the design for nuclear power plants have cross sections that are both ellipses and hyperbolas.
        Three-dimensional solids whose cross sections are hyperbolas are used in some rather unique architectural creations,
        including the TWA building at Kennedy Airport in New York City and the St.
        Louis Science Center Planetarium.

        An explosion is recorded by two microphones that are 2 miles apart.
        Microphone M1 received the sound 4 seconds before microphone M2.
        Assuming sound travels at 1100 feet per second,
        determine the possible locations of the explosion relative to the location of the microphones.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        We begin by putting the microphones in a coordinate system.
        Because 1 mile = 5280 feet,
        we place M1 5280 feet on a horizontal axis to the right of the origin and M2 5280 feet on a horizontal axis to the left of the origin.
        Figure 9.28 illustrates that the two microphones are 2 miles apart.
