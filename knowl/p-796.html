<p>\Question Recall the example from <a href="Inverse_Trigonometry.html" class="internal" title="Section 2.4: Inverse Trigonometric Functions">Section 2.4</a> where Hinemoana is sailing to Rarotonga. We calculated that to sail from Aotearoa to Rarotonga, you would need to sail towards the house Manu Koʻolau (<span class="process-math">\(41.8^{\circ}\)</span>). In reality, there are currents that push the wa‘a off course. Now let’s consider that a current of 2 knots is moving to the house Hikina (East). If we were to face Rarotonga and sail straight, the current put us to the east of our destination. To ensure we arrive at Rarotonga, our apparent heading will need to be a point to the west of our destination, as shown below.</p>
