<p>\Question (SSA) A waʻa is sailing in the direction Hikina (east) at 5 knots and spots an island in the house Lā Koʻolau. 6 hours later the navigator measures the island in the house Manu Hoʻolua. How far is the waʻa from the island at the time of its second measurement? How close did the waʻa get to the island (measure the altitude)?</p>
<p>\Question Recall the example from <a href="Inverse_Trigonometry.html" class="internal" title="Section 2.4: Inverse Trigonometric Functions">Section 2.4</a> where Hinemoana is sailing to Rarotonga. We calculated that to sail from Aotearoa to Rarotonga, you would need to sail towards the house Manu Koʻolau (<span class="process-math">\(41.8^{\circ}\)</span>). In reality, there are currents that push the wa‘a off course. Now let’s consider that a current of 2 knots is moving to the house Hikina (East). If we were to face Rarotonga and sail straight, the current put us to the east of our destination. To ensure we arrive at Rarotonga, our apparent heading will need to be a point to the west of our destination, as shown below.</p>
<p>*(check the direction of the current in real life to make this more realistic)</p>

<p>If we sail at 5 knots, what house will we need to face in order to compensate for the current of 2 knots? First notice that by alternate interior angles, we have that <span class="process-math">\(B=41.8^{\circ}\text{.}\)</span> Now we will write the triangle where the sides represents the speed.</p>
