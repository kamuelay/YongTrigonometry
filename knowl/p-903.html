<p>A voyage undertaken using modern wayfinding must design a course strategy, which includes a reference course for reaching the vicinity of one's destination, hopefully upwind, so that the canoe can sail downwind to the destination rather than having to tack into the wind to get there. (Tacking involves sailing back and forth as closely as possible into the wind to make progress against the wind; it's very arduous and time-consuming, something to be avoided if at all possible, particularly at the end of a long, difficult voyage.)</p>
