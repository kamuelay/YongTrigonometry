<p>It is very rare that a wa‘a sailing on the ocean will be moving in the same direction it’s pointed. One reason for this is that crosswind can push the waʻa off its course. The angle of displacement between the apparent heading of the waʻa and the direction the waʻa is actually traveling through the water is referred to as <em class="emphasis">leeway</em>.  Using vector addition, we can determine where the waʻa will actually travel. However, on the waʻa, the navigator can determine the leeway by observing the angle from the wake behind the waʻa and the apparent direction the waʻa is pointed towards.</p>

<p>In order to compensate for the wind, the navigator must steer the waʻa into the wind by the same angle as the leeway angle. For example, if the waʻa needs to sail in the direction of Manu Malanai (SE) and the wind is pushing the waʻa one house further south, the waʻa will move towards Nālani Malanai (SEbS). To maintain the course of Manu Malanai, the navigator must then point the waʻa one house north with an apparent heading in the house of Noio Malanai (SEbE) in order for the actual heading to be in the house of Manu Malanai (SE).</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="Vectors.html#example-75" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
