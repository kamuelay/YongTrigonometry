<p>Now that we know the star compass, you may be asking how do we tell direction? To do this, we use observations. At night, Thompson uses about 220 stars to tell direction, memorizing where they rise and set on horizon. During the day when the sun is low on the horizon, we can use the sun but as it gets higher, you no longer are able to tell where on the horizon it came from. You can also memorize where the wind and waves are coming from and check to see if it has changed direction between sunrise and sunset.</p>
