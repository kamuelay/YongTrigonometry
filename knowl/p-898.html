<p>It is very rare that a wa‘a sailing on the ocean will be moving in the same direction it’s pointed. One reason for this is that crosswind can push the waʻa off its course. The angle of displacement between the apparent heading of the waʻa and the direction the waʻa is actually traveling through the water is referred to as <em class="emphasis">leeway</em>.  Using vector addition, we can determine where the waʻa will actually travel. However, on the waʻa, the navigator can determine the leeway by observing the angle from the wake behind the waʻa and the apparent direction the waʻa is pointed towards.</p>
