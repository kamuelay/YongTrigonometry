<p>The symmetry in the unit circle is similar to that in the Star Compass. When a star enters the sky in the east, the house that arrives in will be the same house it will set in on the west. For example, if a star first appears in the house Nālani in the Koʻolau quadrant (northeast), it will arc over the sky and enter the horizon in the Hoʻolua quadrant (northwest). This is similar to the symmetry of <span class="process-math">\(P(x,y)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q(-x,y)\text{.}\)</span> Additionally, if an ocean swell or wind comes from the house of Nālani in the Malanai quadrant (southeast), it will leave the waʻa in the opposite direction towards the Hoʻolua quadrant (northwest). This is similar to the symmetry of <span class="process-math">\(S(x,-y)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q(-x,y)\text{.}\)</span></p>
