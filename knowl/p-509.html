<p>\Question Problem 55, p540 in Abramson's book: Standing on the shore of a lake, a fisherman sights a boat far in the distance to his left. Let x, measured in radians, be the angle formed by the line of sight to the ship and a line due north from his position. Assume due north is 0 and x is measured negative to the left and positive to the right. (See Figure 19.) The boat travels from due west to due east and, ignoring the curvature of the Earth, the distance d(x), in kilometers, from the fisherman to the boat is given by the function d(x) = 1.5sec(x).</p>
