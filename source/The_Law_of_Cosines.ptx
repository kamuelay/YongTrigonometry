    <p>
      The Fijian canoe Uto Ni Yalo is sailing from Fiji to Tonga.
      The navigators know Tonga is 412 NM from Fiji in the House L&#257; Malanai
      (<m>16.81^{\circ}</m>).
      After sailing for one day and traveling 120 NM, the navigator determines they have gone off course by 2 houses
      (<m>22.5^{\circ}</m>).
      How far are they from Tonga and what is the angle that they will need to turn in order to reach their destination?

      This triangle,
      where we know two sides and the angle between them,
      is known as Side-Angle-Side (SAS).
      Unfortunately,
      the Law of Sines that we learned in <xref ref="The_Law_of_Sines">Section</xref>
      only applies to ASA, AAS, and SSA. In this section,
      we will learn how to solve SAS triangles as well as triangles where all three sides are known,
      called Side-Side-Side (SSS) triangles.

          Thus, in any triangle,
          the square of one side equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides,
          minus twice their product times the cosine of their included angle.

    <p>
      Note: If the triangle is a right triangle,
      say <m>C=90^{\circ}</m>, then since <m>\cos90^{\circ}=0</m>,
      the Law of Cosines simplifies into the Pythagorean Theorem:
      <m>c^2=a^2+b^2</m>.
    </p>
    <proof>

        To prove the first part,
        we will place a triangle with <m>A</m> at the origin and <m>C</m> on the <m>x</m>-axis,
        as shown below.

      <solution>
        <p>
          The distance to Tonga can be found using the Law of Cosines
          <md>
            <mrow>a^2\amp =\amp b^2+c^2-2bc\cos A</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =\amp 412^2+120^2-2\cdot412\cdot120\cos22.5^{\circ}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp \approx\amp 92,790.79</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          Taking the square root of both sides we get
          <me>
            a\approx\sqrt{92,790.79}\approx304.62
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus they are approximately 305 NM from their destination.
        </p>
        <p>
          To determine the angle needed to adjust their course,
          we will first find <m>B</m> and subtract that from <m>180^{\circ}</m>.
          We can use either the Law of Sines or the Law of Cosines.
          If we use the Law of Sines
          <me>
            \frac{\sin A}{a}=\frac{\sin B}{b}
          </me>
          we know <m>a\approx304.62</m>,
          <m>b=412</m>, and <m>A=22.5^{\circ}</m>.
          Notice this is the case SSA for Law of Sines where we get two triangles.
          Since we already know what the triangle looks like,
          we want the measure for <m>B</m> that makes it obtuse.
          However, to avoid this ambiguous case,
          we can simply use the Law of Cosines
          <me>
            b^2=a^2+c^2-2ac\cos B
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Rearranging we have
          <me>
            \cos B=\frac{a^2+c^2-b^2}{2ac}\approx\frac{304.62^2+120^2-412^2}{2\cdot304.62\cdot120}\approx-0.8556
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          So,
          <me>
            B\approx\cos^{-1}(-0.8556)\approx148.83^{\circ}
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus the angle Uto Ni Yalo needs to turn to adjust its course is <m>180^{\circ}-148.83^{\circ}=31.17^{\circ}</m> to the left.

        <p>

        <p>
          To find <m>B</m>, we continue with the Law of Cosines to get:

        <p>

      The Greek mathematician, Heron of Alexandria,

          The Polynesian Triangle is an area in the Pacific Ocean consisting of over 1,000 islands.
          These islands are collectively known as Polynesia.
          The northern corner of the Polynesian Triangle is made up of the Hawaiian Islands,
          the southwestern corner is made up of Aotearoa,
          and the southeastern corner is made up with Rapa Nui.
          It is believed that the first inhabitants to the islands arrived at Ka Lae, Hawai`i; Hokianga, Aotearoa;
          and Anakena, Rapa Nui, respectively.
          The distance between Ka Lae, Hawai`i and Hokianga, Aotearoa is 4,250 miles,
          the distance between Hokianga, Aotearoa and Anakena, Rapa Nui is 4,500 miles,
          and the distance between Rapa Nui and Ka Lae, Hawai`i is 4,450 miles.
