        <title>latitude sailing</title>
        <p>
          A navigational technique in which a canoe sails north or south to reach the latitude of its destination before turning east or west. Because stars move in an arc from east to west, they do not provide a precise measure of longitude. However, their positions and movements shift with latitude. By tracking these changes, navigators can determine when they have reached the correct latitude, allowing them to adjust course toward their destination.
