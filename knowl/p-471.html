<p>Every day as the Earth spins on its axis, the Sun rises from the eastern horizon. However, only twice a year will the sun rise due east, in the house Hikina. One occurrence is during the spring equinox. In the northern hemisphere, as spring turns into summer, the position the sun rises from will slowly move north, until the summer solstice, when the sun will rise from the most northern point (<span class="process-math">\(23.44^{\circ}\)</span> or the house ʻĀina Koʻolau). After this, the position of the rising sun will move south until the fall equinox where the sun will once again rise from due east or Hikina, before continuing its southern movement until the winter solstice when the sun will rise from its southern most position (<span class="process-math">\(-23.44^{\circ}\)</span> or the house ʻĀina Malanai). As winter turns to spring, the sun rise will start to move north until the next spring equinox where the position of the sun rise will once again be due east (Hikina). This process takes one year before it repeats itself year after year. This pattern of the position of the sun rise is a periodic function.</p>
