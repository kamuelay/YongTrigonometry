<p>When Mau Pialug sailed to his home on the Makali`i in 1999, the people of Satawal, Micronesia were impressed with such a large waʻa. As a gift to the man who shared his knowledge of navigation, Nā Kālai Waʻa at Kawaihae Harbor built a 56-foot long double-hulled voyaging canoe called the Alingano Maisu. In 2007, the Alingano Maisu, accompanied by the Hōkūleʻa, embarked on her maiden voyage to her new home in Satawal so Papa Mau can carry on his legacy of navigation in his home islands. Leaving Hawai`i, Hōkūleʻa led the way to Johnston Atoll. From there, the Alingano Maisu took the lead as they entered Micronesia by first stopping at Majuro, Marshall Islands before continuing on to her new home in Satawal. It is known that the island of Majuro is 1,108 nautical miles to the east and 575 nautical miles to the south of Johnston Atoll. What house do you need to sail towards and what distance will you need to sail? If the waʻa travels at 5 knots, how many days will it take to reach the destination? Note that 1 knot = 1 nautical mile/hour.</p>
