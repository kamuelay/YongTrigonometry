<body class="ignore-math"><article class="exercise exercise-like"><p>(Sunrise on Mauna Kea) The summit of Mauna Kea is the highest point in Hawai`i and sits 13,803 ft above the sea level. If you stand at the summit, you will be able to see the sun rise before someone standing at the sea level just north or south of Mauna Kea (at the same latitude). In fact, you will see the sunrise at the same time as someone at sea level sailing in a wa‘a to the east of Mauna Kea. \begin{tasks} \task How far is the horizon when someone 5 ft tall stands on the summit to watch the sun rise? \task How much faster will you see the sun rise than someone standing nearby at sea level? Hint: the ratio of your previous answer to the circumference of the Earth is equal to the ratio of the time to the 24 hours in Earth’s rotation. \end{tasks} It turns out you will see the sunrise 8.33 mins before someone at the sea level.</p>
<p>\Question <em class="emphasis">Sunrise on Haleakalā</em></p>
<p>According to moʻolelo, or legend, the sun traveled very fast across the sky, leaving people with days so short there was not enough time to carry on with their daily lives. Determined to slow the sun, the demigod Maui climbed to the summit of Haleakalā, which stands at 10,023 feet, to snare the sun. Assume the radius of the earth is at Haleakalā is 3961.527 miles.</p>
