    <p>
      Earth's axial tilt is the angle between the Earth's rotational axis and its orbital plane around the Sun. The Earth's axis is tilted at an angle of approximately 23.5 degrees relative to the plane of its orbit. This axial tilt is the primary factor that contributes to the changing seasons and the variation in sunlight distribution throughout the year.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the Earth orbits the Sun, different parts of the Earth receive varying amounts of sunlight, leading to the seasons. When one hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun, it receives more direct sunlight and experiences summer, while the other hemisphere, tilted away from the Sun, receives less direct sunlight and experiences winter. The equinoxes, which occur when neither hemisphere is tilted towards or away from the Sun, mark the transition between seasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the summer solstice, which typically falls around June 21st in the Northern Hemisphere, the North Pole is tilted towards the Sun. This results in the Northern Hemisphere receiving more direct sunlight and experiencing longer days. Conversely, the Southern Hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun, resulting in less direct sunlight and shorter days, leading to winter in the Southern Hemisphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the winter solstice, around December 21st in the Northern Hemisphere, the North Pole is tilted away from the Sun. The Northern Hemisphere receives less direct sunlight and experiences shorter days, leading to winter, while the Southern Hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun, experiencing summer with more direct sunlight and longer days.
    </p>
    <p>
      The equinoxes occur around March 20th and September 22nd, during which neither hemisphere is tilted towards or away from the Sun. This results in roughly equal lengths of day and night all over the world, marking the transition from winter to spring and from summer to autumn/fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The axial tilt, combined with the Earth's orbit around the Sun, creates a cyclical pattern of changing seasons and varying sunlight distribution throughout the year. This phenomenon has profound effects on climate, temperature, and ecological patterns on Earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The seasons on Earth are caused by <term>axial tilt</term>.
      <idx><h>axial tilt</h></idx>
    </p>
    <p>
      During the equinoxes, around March 20th and September 22nd, the Sun rises due east, and day and night are roughly equal in duration all around the globe. These dates mark the transition from one season to anotherâ€”spring to summer and summer to autumn/fall, respectively, in the Northern Hemisphere (and fall to winter and winter to spring in the Southern Hemisphere).
    </p>
    <p>
      After the <term>spring equinox</term>,
      <idx><h>equinox</h><h>spring</h></idx>
      as the Earth continues its orbit around the Sun, the Northern Hemisphere tilts towards the Sun. This causes the Sun's rising position to move northward each day. By the time of the <term>summer solstice</term>,
      <idx><h>solstice</h><h>summer</h></idx>
      around June 20th, the Sun rises from its northernmost position for the year, resulting in the longest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere (and the shortest day in the Southern Hemisphere).
    </p>
    <p>
      Following the summer solstice, the Earth's axial tilt remains the same, but the northern hemisphere starts tilting away from the Sun. This causes the Sun's rising position to gradually shift southward each day. By the time of the <term>fall equinox</term>,
      <idx><h>equinox</h><h>fall</h></idx>
      around September 22nd, the Sun rises due east again, and day and night are once more equal in duration.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the Northern Hemisphere continues to tilt away from the Sun, the Sun's rising position moves even further south each day. By the time of the <term>winter solstice</term>,
      <idx><h>solstice</h><h>winter</h></idx>
      around December 21st, the Sun rises from its southernmost position, resulting in the shortest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere (and the longest day in the Southern Hemisphere).
    </p>
    <p>
      After the winter solstice, the Northern Hemisphere begins tilting back towards the Sun, causing the Sun's rising position to gradually shift northward each day. This movement continues until the next spring equinox, completing the annual cycle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, the changing position of the sunrise throughout the year is a result of the Earth's combined with its orbit around the Sun.
    </p>

    </figure>
    <p>
      The pattern of the position where the Sun rises throughout the year can be described as a <term>periodic function</term> which repeats itself in approximately one year. This function can be graphically represented as the position of the sunrise on the horizon relative to Hikina or east as a function of time. This function would show the gradual northward and southward movement of the sunrise position throughout the year, with certain key dates marking significant points in this pattern, such as the equinoxes and solstices.
    </p>
    <p>
      By analyzing and studying this periodic function, astronomers and scientists can make predictions about the position of the sunrise on any given day of the year, as well as observe and understand the seasonal variations in sunlight and daylight hours experienced at different latitudes on Earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this section we will learn how to graph the sine and cosine functions and use that information to make predictions about the position of the sunrise on any given day of the year, as well as observe and understand the seasonal variations in sunlight and daylight hours experienced at different latitudes on Earth.
      The graphs of the remaining trigonometric functions that were discussed in <xref ref="Trigonometry">Chapter</xref> will be covered in <xref ref="Graphs_of_Other_Trigonometric_Functions">Section</xref>.

    <p>
      Division is not required for the trigonometric functions <m>\sin\theta</m> and
      <m>\cos\theta</m> and so we do not need to worry about dividing by zero,
      thus <m>\theta</m> can be any angle.
      In other words, the domains for <m>\sin\theta</m> and
      <m>\cos\theta</m> consist of the set of all real numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, looking at <m>\tan\theta</m> and <m>\sec\theta</m>,
      you may notice there is division by <m>x</m>.
      We run into problems when <m>x=0</m> because it would result in dividing by 0.
      These are the points when the terminal side of <m>\theta</m> lies on the <m>y</m>-axis.
      On the unit circle, the points are <m>(0,1)</m> and <m>(0,-1)</m>.
      These points correspond to the angles <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m> and
      <m>\frac{3\pi}{2}</m> (<m>90^{\circ}</m> and <m>270^{\circ}</m>),
      as well as all their coterminal angles:
      <m>\ldots, -\frac{3\pi}{2}, \frac{-\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{3\pi}{2}, \frac{5\pi}{2}, \ldots</m>
      (<m>\ldots, -270^{\circ}, -90^{\circ}, 90^{\circ}, 270^{\circ}, 450^{\circ}, \ldots</m>).
      In general, any angle of the form
      <m>\frac{\pi}{2}+n\pi</m> (<m>90^{\circ}+180^{\circ}\cdot n</m>) for some integer <m>n</m> should be excluded from the domain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, we run into problems for <m>\csc\theta</m> and
      <m>\cot\theta</m> when <m>y=0</m> since we would divide by 0.
      This corresponds to when the terminal side of <m>\theta</m> lies on the <m>x</m>-axis.
      These points on the unit circle are <m>(1,0)</m> and <m>(-1,0)</m> and have corresponding angles <m>0</m> and <m>\pi</m>,
      as well as all their coterminal angles:
      <m>\ldots, -2\pi, -\pi, 0, \pi, 2\pi, \ldots</m>
      (<m>\ldots, -360^{\circ}, -180^{\circ}, 0^{\circ}, 180^{\circ}, 360^{\circ}, \ldots</m>).
      In general, any angle of the form
      <m>\pi\cdot n</m> (<m>180^{\circ}\cdot n</m>) for some integer <m>n</m> should be excluded from the domain.

      Next we look at the range for each of the trigonometric functions.
      If <m>P(x,y)</m> is a point on the unit circle,
      then we have <m>-1\leq x\leq1</m> and <m>-1\leq y\le1</m>.
      Since <m>\sin\theta=y</m> and <m>\cos\theta=x</m>,
      it follows that <m>-1\leq\sin\theta\leq1</m> and <m>-1\leq\cos\theta\leq1</m>.

    Find the equation for the time that Makalii (Pleiades) emerges over the horizon over time throughout the year.
          Talk about the importance of this and how when it rises at sunset,
          it coincides with the start of Makahiki season.
          Then using an example that we already worked with the sun and the time the sun sets over the year,
          find the intersection of these two equations to determine when Makahiki season will begin.

          ``The rising of Makali`i
          (the constellation Pleiades)
          at sunset marks the beginning of the Hawaiian new year,
          known as Makahiki.
          Makahiki usally begins mid-November and ends in late January or February,
          aligning with the rainy season.
          It is a time set aside for tribute, harvest, sport,
          and play. " "<url href="\1"/>

    Problem 55, p540 in Abramson's book: Standing on the shore of a lake,
          a fisherman sights a boat far in the distance to his left.
          Let x, measured in radians,
          be the angle formed by the line of sight to the ship and a line due north from his position.
          Assume due north is 0 and x is measured negative to the left and positive to the right.
          (See Figure 19.)
          The boat travels from due west to due east and,
          ignoring the curvature of the Earth,
          the distance d(x), in kilometers,
          from the fisherman to the boat is given by the function d(x) = 1.5sec(x).
