    <title>The Tangent Function</title>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="subsec_periodic-functions"/> we learned that tangent is a periodic function with a period of <m>\pi</m>. To graph <m>y=\tan x</m>, we can focus on plotting one period and then repeat those values to complete the graph. Before choosing an interval for plotting, let's revisit the definition of tangent:
    </p>
    <p>
      <me>
        \tan x = \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      However, issues arise when the denominator is zero, i.e., when <m>\cos x=0</m>. This leads to undefined points at <m>\ldots, -\frac{3\pi}{2}, -\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{3\pi}{2}, \frac{5\pi}{2}, \ldots</m>. In general, any angle of the form <m>n\frac{\pi}{2}</m>, where <m>n</m> is an odd integer, should be excluded from the domain since tangent is undefined at these values. In fact, any line of the form <m>x=n\frac{\pi}{2}</m> (e.g. <m>x=-\frac{\pi}{2}</m> and <m>x=\frac{\pi}{2}</m>) is a <term>vertical asymptote</term><idx><h>vertical asymptote</h></idx> 
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that we know where tangent is undefined, we will choose the interval <m>\left(-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}\right)</m> to plot our points for tangent. This interval has a length of <m>\pi</m> (one period), allowing us to repeat the values to complete the graph of tangent. Values of tangent for known angles are listed in <xref ref="tab_tan-graph-values">Table</xref> and plotted in <xref ref="tan-points-labeled">Figure</xref>.

  <p>
    Division is not required for the trigonometric functions <m>\sin\theta</m> and <m>\cos\theta</m> and so we do not need to worry about dividing by zero,
    thus <m>\theta</m> can be any angle. In other words, the domains for <m>\sin\theta</m> and <m>\cos\theta</m> consist of the set of all real numbers.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, looking at <m>\tan\theta</m> and <m>\sec\theta</m>, you may notice there is division by <m>x</m>. We run into problems when the denominator is zero, in other words, <m>x=0</m> would result in dividing by 0. These are the points when the terminal side of <m>\theta</m> lies on the <m>y</m>-axis. On the unit circle, the points are <m>(0,1)</m> and <m>(0,-1)</m>. These points correspond to the angles <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m> and<m>\frac{3\pi}{2}</m>, as well as all their coterminal angles:
    <m>\ldots, -\frac{3\pi}{2}, \frac{-\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{3\pi}{2}, \frac{5\pi}{2}, \ldots</m>. In general, any angle of the form
    <m>\frac{\pi}{2}+n\pi</m> for some integer <m>n</m> should be excluded from the domain.
  </p>
  <p>
    Similarly, we run into problems for <m>\csc\theta</m> and <m>\cot\theta</m> when <m>y=0</m> since we would divide by 0. This corresponds to when the terminal side of <m>\theta</m> lies on the <m>x</m>-axis. These points on the unit circle are <m>(1,0)</m> and <m>(-1,0)</m> and have corresponding angles <m>0</m> and <m>\pi</m>, as well as all their coterminal angles: <m>\ldots, -2\pi, -\pi, 0, \pi, 2\pi, \ldots</m>. In general, any angle of the form <m>\pi\cdot n</m> for some integer <m>n</m> should be excluded from the domain.

    Next we look at the range for each of the trigonometric functions. If <m>P(x,y)</m> is a point on the unit circle, then we have <m>-1\leq x\leq1</m> and <m>-1\leq y\le1</m>. Since <m>\sin\theta=y</m> and <m>\cos\theta=x</m>, it follows that <m>-1\leq\sin\theta\leq1</m> and <m>-1\leq\cos\theta\leq1</m>.

  Find the equation for the time that Makalii (Pleiades) emerges over the horizon over time throughout the year.
        Talk about the importance of this and how when it rises at sunset,
        it coincides with the start of Makahiki season.
        Then using an example that we already worked with the sun and the time the sun sets over the year,
        find the intersection of these two equations to determine when Makahiki season will begin.

        ``The rising of Makali`i
        (the constellation Pleiades)
        at sunset marks the beginning of the Hawaiian new year,
        known as Makahiki.
        Makahiki usally begins mid-November and ends in late January or February,
        aligning with the rainy season.
        It is a time set aside for tribute, harvest, sport,
        and play. " "<url href="\1"/>

  Problem 55, p540 in Abramson's book: Standing on the shore of a lake,
        a fisherman sights a boat far in the distance to his left.
        Let x, measured in radians,
        be the angle formed by the line of sight to the ship and a line due north from his position.
        Assume due north is 0 and x is measured negative to the left and positive to the right.
        (See Figure 19.)
        The boat travels from due west to due east and,
        ignoring the curvature of the Earth,
        the distance d(x), in kilometers,
        from the fisherman to the boat is given by the function d(x) = 1.5sec(x).
