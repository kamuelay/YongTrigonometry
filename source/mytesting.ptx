  <title>Hawaiian Star Compass</title>
  <p>
    Pacific Islanders have been wayfinding across long distances in the Pacific long before the magnetic compasses or other instruments were introduced.
    Navigators relied on observations of the stars, sun, ocean, winds,
    and other signs from nature to determine their position.
    Through time,
    much of the art and science of traditional wayfinding was lost across the Pacific,
    except with a few navigators.
    The island of Satawal in the Federated States of Micronesia was home to Mau Piailug,
    one of the last traditional navigators.
    To determine his position, Mau used the <em>paafu</em>,
        <idx><h>Paafu</h></idx>
    a Micronesian <em>Star Compass</em>
        <idx><h>Star Compass</h></idx>
    which is mental construct used to help determine position by memorizing things important to navigation,
    such as the position of stars when they rise and set on the horizon.
    The star compass also reads the flight path of birds and the direction of winds and waves.
  </p>
  <p>
    Wanting to revive wayfinding in Hawai<sq>i, Nainoa Thompson traveled to the island of Satawal to learn from Mau Piailug.
    Thompson adopted Mau</sq>s star compass,
    resulting in the Hawaiian Star Compass
    (<xref ref="fig_star-compass">Figure</xref>).

  <p>
    In the star compass, Thompson divides the visual horizon into 32 equidistant points around a circle,
    called houses.
    Houses represent a space on the horizon where a celestial bodies such as the sun, stars,
    moon, and planets rise and set.
    In the same way that we have addresses to help people find our homes,
    each celestial body has its own address represented with these houses.
  </p>
  <p>
    The four cardinal points correspond to a house.
    The stars arrive from the horizon called <em>Hikina</em> (
    <q>To Arrive</q>
    ) or East and enter the horizon called <em>Komohana</em> (
    <q>To Enter</q>
    ) or West.
    If you stand with your back towards Hikina (East) and face Komohana (West),
    your right will point towards <em>`\=Akau</em> (
    <q>Right</q>
    ) or North and your left will point towards <em>Hema</em> (
    <q>Left</q>
    ) or South.
  </p>
  <p>
    These four cardinal points divide the compass into four quadrants.
    Each quadrant is named after winds in Hawai`i.
    <em>Ko`olau</em> is the Northeast quadrant named for the trade winds;
    <em>Ho`olua</em> is the Northwest quadrant,
    <em>Kona</em> is the Southwest quadrant;
    and <em>Malanai</em> is the Southeast quadrant.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each house on the compass has a name.
    The corresponding houses in the east and in the west share a name.
    Starting in the east or west and moving northwards and southwards is the first house positioned on either side of Hikina (East) and Komohana (West).
    This is the house L\={a} (Sun).
    It is followed by `\=Aina (Land), Noio (Tern), Manu (Bird), N\={a}lani (Heavens), N\={a} Leo (Voices),
    and Haka (Empty).
    The 32 houses in the Hawaiian Star Compass correspond to the points of the 32-wind compass rose
    (<xref ref="tab_compass">Table</xref>).
    The celestial bodies move in parallel paths across the sky from East to West,
    rising and setting in the same house,
    remaining in its hemisphere
    (<xref ref="fig_celestial-sphere2">Figure</xref>).
  </p>
  <p>
    For example,
    if a star arrives in the Ko`olau (northeastern) quadrant in the star house Noio,
    it will arc overhead,
    staying in the northern hemisphere and enters the horizon in the same house it arrived in, Noio,
    but in the Ho`olua (northwest) quadrant.
    If a star arrives in the Malanai (southeast) quadrant in the house L\={a}, it will remain in the southern hemisphere as it arcs overhead and enters the horizon in the house L\={a} in the Kona (southwestern) quadrant.
  </p>

    <caption>Celestial Sphere. (image from PVS)</caption>
    <image width="40%" source="celestial_sphere.jpg"/>
  </figure>
  <p>
    The star compass is also used to determine direction based on wind and ocean swells.
    As the wind and swells move, they cross the star compass diagonally.
    If a wind is blowing from the house `\={a}ina in the Ko`olau (northeast) quadrant,
    it would blow in the direction of the Kona (southwest) quadrant and exit at the same house it originated from, `\={a}ina.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now that we know the star compass,
    you may be asking how do we tell direction?
    To do this, we use observations.
    At night, Thompson uses about 220 stars to tell direction,
    memorizing where they rise and set on horizon.
    During the day when the sun is low on the horizon,
    we can use the sun but as it gets higher,
    you no longer are able to tell where on the horizon it came from.
    You can also memorize where the wind and waves are coming from and check to see if it has changed direction between sunrise and sunset.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to the star compass,
    many cultures across the Pacific use a <em>wind compass</em>.
    Similar to the star compass, the wind compass is also a mental construct.
