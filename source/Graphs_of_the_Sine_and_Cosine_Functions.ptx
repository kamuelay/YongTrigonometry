  <introduction>
    <p>
      Sunrise and sunset are vital markers for navigational orientation and course corrections. During sunrise, you can determine the direction and observe the origin of wind and waves. As the sun rises higher, steering by the sun becomes impractical, and you must instead depend on swells to keep your course. At sunset, you can reassess your position and take note of any changes in wind and swell patterns. Although the general pattern is for the sun to rise in the east and set in the west, its exact position on the horizon varies throughout the year.
    </p>
    <p>
      To understand why the position changes, we must first learn about Earth's <term>axial tilt</term>, <idx><h>axial tilt</h></idx> which represents the angle between the Earth's rotational axis and its orbital plane around the Sun. To conceptualize this tilt, envision a pole passing through the Earth's center, extending from the North to South Pole, with the Earth revolving around this axis. Each complete rotation of the Earth on this axis corresponds to one day. As the Earth travels along its orbit around the Sun with a constant tilt, the orientation of the Earth's axial tilt causes either the North Pole or the South Pole to tilt toward the Sun. This tilt varies depending on the Earth's location in its orbit relative to the Sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the equinoxes, which mark the transition from winter to spring and from summer to fall, the Earth's axis is not tilted towards or away from the Sun. Consequently, on these days, the Sun rises due east and sets due west, and the duration of day and night is approximately equal.
    </p>

    </figure> -->
    <p>
      Following the <term>fall equinox</term>
      <idx><h>equinox</h><h>fall</h></idx> in the Southern Hemisphere, typically occurring around March 20th, the Earth proceeds along its orbit around the Sun, leading the Southern Hemisphere to tilt away from the Sun. As a result, the Sun's rising position progressively moves northward each day. By the time of the <term>winter solstice</term>,
      <idx><h>solstice</h><h>winter</h></idx> around June 20th, the Sun rises from its northernmost position, resulting in the shortest day in the Southern Hemisphere and the longest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the winter solstice, the Earth's axial tilt remains the same, but the Southern Hemisphere starts tilting toward the Sun. This causes the Sun's rising position to gradually shift southward each day. When the <term>spring equinox</term>
      <idx><h>equinox</h><h>spring</h></idx> arrives, approximately on September 22nd, the Sun rises due east once again, and day and night are once more of equal duration.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the Southern Hemisphere continues to tilt towards the Sun, the Sun's rising position moves even further south each day. By the time of the <term>summer solstice</term>,
      <idx><h>solstice</h><h>summer</h></idx> approximately on December 21st, the Sun rises from its southernmost position, resulting in the longest day of the year in the Southern Hemisphere and the shortest day in the Northern Hemisphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following the summer solstice, the Southern Hemisphere begins tilting away from the Sun, causing the Sun's rising position to gradually shift northward each day. This movement continues until the next fall equinox, completing the annual cycle.

        <caption>Illustration shows the relative positions and timing of solstice, equinox and seasons in relation to the Earth's orbit around the Sun and the axial tilt. During the June solstice, the northern hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun, while the southern hemisphere is tilted away. Conversely, during the December solstice, the southern hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun, and the northern hemisphere is tilted away. During the March and September equinoxes, the Earth's axis is perpendicular to the line connecting the Earth to the Sun, causing the Sun to appear directly above the equator. As a result, day and night are approximately equal in length all over the world.</caption>

      The position where the Sun rises throughout the year exhibits a repeating pattern, characterized as a <term>periodic function</term> with a cycle of about one year. This function can be mathematically represented as either a sine or cosine function. Graphically, it illustrates the sunrise position on the horizon relative to the east (Hikina) as time progresses. By examining this function, we can observe the gradual northward and southward movement of the sunrise position throughout the year. Key dates such as the equinoxes and solstices mark significant points in this pattern, providing insights into the changing seasons and variations in daylight hours.

      In this section, we will explore the graphs of the sine and cosine functions through their periodic nature. Studying the graphs of sine and cosine functions provides valuable insights into the world around us. The graphs of the remaining trigonometric functions will be covered in <xref ref="Graphs_of_Other_Trigonometric_Functions">Section</xref>.

    <title>The Sine Function</title>
    <convention>
      <p>
        In <xref ref="Trigonometry">Chapter</xref>, trigonometric functions typically use <m>\theta</m> or <m>t</m> as the variable in the domain, such as <m>y=\cos\theta</m> and <m>y=\sin t</m>. However, when graphing functions on the Cartesian plane (<m>xy</m>-coordinate system), <m>x</m> is conventionally used as the variable in the domain. Therefore, when graphing trigonometric functions, we will use <m>x</m> as the variable, for example <m>y=\cos x</m> and <m>y=\sin x</m>.
      </p>
    </convention>
    
    <p>
      The sine function, as discussed in <xref ref="core-standardsCCSS_MATH_CONTENT_HSF_TF_A_4-a">Section</xref>, is a periodic functions with period <m>2\pi</m>. To graph <m>y=\sin x</m>, we can focus on the interval <m>[0,2\pi]</m>. By plotting this interval, we can then repeat the values to complete the remaining graph.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recall from <xref ref="def-of-trig-functions">Definition</xref> that on the unit circle, <m>\sin \theta</m> is defined to be the <m>y</m>-value of the terminal point <m>P(x,y)</m> on the unit circle associated with the angle <m>t</m>. As the angle increases from <m>0</m> to <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m>, the <m>y</m>-value also increases from <m>0</m> to <m>1</m>. When the angle continues from <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m> to <m>\frac{3\pi}{2}</m>, the <m>y</m>-value decreases from <m>1</m> to <m>-1</m>. Finally, as the angle approaches <m>2\pi</m>, the <m>y</m>-value increases to <m>0</m>. This behavior is shown in <xref ref="sine-graph-animation">Figure</xref>.
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="sine-graph-animation">

        The sketch of the <m>y=\sin x</m> can be drawn by plotting the corresponding <m>y</m>-value for each corresponding angle <m>x</m>. In this interactive figure, select Sine or Cosine to draw the function and click Start Animation to begin.

      Division is not required for the trigonometric functions <m>\sin\theta</m> and
      <m>\cos\theta</m> and so we do not need to worry about dividing by zero,
      thus <m>\theta</m> can be any angle.
      In other words, the domains for <m>\sin\theta</m> and
      <m>\cos\theta</m> consist of the set of all real numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, looking at <m>\tan\theta</m> and <m>\sec\theta</m>,
      you may notice there is division by <m>x</m>.
      We run into problems when <m>x=0</m> because it would result in dividing by 0.
      These are the points when the terminal side of <m>\theta</m> lies on the <m>y</m>-axis.
      On the unit circle, the points are <m>(0,1)</m> and <m>(0,-1)</m>.
      These points correspond to the angles <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m> and
      <m>\frac{3\pi}{2}</m> (<m>90^{\circ}</m> and <m>270^{\circ}</m>),
      as well as all their coterminal angles:
      <m>\ldots, -\frac{3\pi}{2}, \frac{-\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{3\pi}{2}, \frac{5\pi}{2}, \ldots</m>
      (<m>\ldots, -270^{\circ}, -90^{\circ}, 90^{\circ}, 270^{\circ}, 450^{\circ}, \ldots</m>).
      In general, any angle of the form
      <m>\frac{\pi}{2}+n\pi</m> (<m>90^{\circ}+180^{\circ}\cdot n</m>) for some integer <m>n</m> should be excluded from the domain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, we run into problems for <m>\csc\theta</m> and
      <m>\cot\theta</m> when <m>y=0</m> since we would divide by 0.
      This corresponds to when the terminal side of <m>\theta</m> lies on the <m>x</m>-axis.
      These points on the unit circle are <m>(1,0)</m> and <m>(-1,0)</m> and have corresponding angles <m>0</m> and <m>\pi</m>,
      as well as all their coterminal angles:
      <m>\ldots, -2\pi, -\pi, 0, \pi, 2\pi, \ldots</m>
      (<m>\ldots, -360^{\circ}, -180^{\circ}, 0^{\circ}, 180^{\circ}, 360^{\circ}, \ldots</m>).
      In general, any angle of the form
      <m>\pi\cdot n</m> (<m>180^{\circ}\cdot n</m>) for some integer <m>n</m> should be excluded from the domain.

      Next we look at the range for each of the trigonometric functions.
      If <m>P(x,y)</m> is a point on the unit circle,
      then we have <m>-1\leq x\leq1</m> and <m>-1\leq y\le1</m>.
      Since <m>\sin\theta=y</m> and <m>\cos\theta=x</m>,
      it follows that <m>-1\leq\sin\theta\leq1</m> and <m>-1\leq\cos\theta\leq1</m>.

      Recall that <m>\cos(0)=0</m> but so do <m>\cos(0+2\pi)=\cos2\pi=0</m>.
      In fact, if we add or subtract any multiple of <m>2\pi</m> to our angle,
      we will obtain the same value for cosine.
      Functions such as these are known as
      <em>periodic functions</em>
