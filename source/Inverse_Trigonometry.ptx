  <introduction>
    <p>
      Swells are one of the most consistent navigational tools for maintaining a straight course due to their consistency over longer periods of time. Unlike stars that may be obscured during the day or on cloudy nights, and winds that can frequently change direction, swells tend to remain relatively constant. By keeping the angle at which the swell passes the canoe constant, crew members can navigate on a straight course.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even in poor visibility, when the crew may not be able to see the swells, they can still feel them. Parts of the waka (canoe) will lift and then lower as the swells pass beneath. Skilled navigators can use these movements to maintain course, even without directly seeing the waves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The side-to-side rocking motion of the canoe is known as <term>roll</term>. This motion occurs when a swell approaches from either the port (left) or starboard (right) side, causing the waka to initially lift the corresponding hull (port or starboard), followed by the opposite hull, depending on the direction of the swell.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a swell approaches from the bow (front) of the canoe, it lifts the front, causing the canoe to tilt backward before tilting forward. This motion is known as <term>pitch.</term> Conversely, if the swell comes from the stern (back), the canoe tilts forward and then backward.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a swell approaches the canoe from an angle that is not perpendicular to any side, a combination of pitch and roll occurs. The specific motion experienced depends on the precise angle of the swell. For instance, if the swell comes from an angle and lifts the starboard bow (front right), it may subsequently lift the port bow, followed by the starboard stern, and finally the port stern. However, with a slightly different angle, the sequence may change as well. After lifting the starboard bow, it could lead to the starboard stern being lifted next, followed by the port bow, and finally the port stern. This twisting motion is referred to as a <term>corkscrew</term> effect due to its combination of motions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The video in <xref ref="video-swell-movement">Figure</xref> shows hows a waka moves as swells pass under the hulls. A change in waka motion can indicate either a change in the canoe's direction or a shift in the direction of ocean swells. In such cases, the crew must assess the situation and when conditions allow, utilize celestial markers, such as the rising and setting of stars, to determine the direction of the swells.
    </p>

    <p>
      As the waka Paikea sails north in the Cook Islands from Rarotonga to Aitutaki with a heading of <m>0^{\circ}</m>, the swells are approaching the waka from the southwest and moving towards the northeast. Referring to <xref ref="star-compass-with-heading-angles">Figure</xref>, which provides heading angles, we observe that the swells have a heading ranging between <m>0^{\circ}</m> (north) and <m>90^{\circ}</m> (east).
    </p> 
    <p>
      Additional observations of the crew reveal the swells hit Paikea in the following order: 1) port stern (back left); 2) starboard stern (back right); 3) port bow (front left); and 4) starboard bow (front right), as shown in <xref ref="waa-currents">Figure</xref>. If Paikea is 14.8 m (50 ft) in length and 6.2 m (20 ft) in width, what is the possible range of headings from which the swells may be approaching?

    To determine the range of headings, we start by considering one boundary, which occurs when the swells are moving directly north with a heading of <m>0^{\circ}</m>. To identify the other boundary, we want to find the angle at which the swell intersects both the starboard stern and port bow simultaneously as it passes beneath the waka. Essentially, we want to find the angle that diagonally traverses the canoe from one corner to another. To simplify this, we represent the waka as a rectangle and create a triangle by connecting the corners. The angle, denoted as <m>\theta</m>, is formed between the side adjacent to the 14.8 m length of the canoe and the diagonal. This angle corresponds to the heading of the swells, as shown in <xref ref="waa-currents-dimensions">Figure</xref>.

      You may notice that for our given angle, <m>\theta</m>, we have the opposite side of length 6.2 m and the adjacent side of length 14.8 m, which are both related to the tangent function:
      <me>
        \tan\theta=\frac{14.8}{6.2}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Until now, the angles for the trigonometric problems we encountered were given. However, to solve for the angle <m>\theta</m>, we cannot simply divide by <q>tan</q> since it is part of the tangent function, which takes an angle as input and provides a ratio of sides as output. To find the angle <m>\theta</m>, we need to use the inverse function, which takes the ratio of sides as input and provides an angle as output. In this section, we will explore inverse trigonometric functions, including their properties and usage.

    <title>Alternate Introduction</title>
    <p>
      When Mau Pialug sailed to his home on the Makali`i in 1999,
      the people of Satawal, Micronesia were impressed with such a large wa&#699;a.
      As a gift to the man who shared his knowledge of navigation, N&#257; K&#257;lai Wa&#699;a at Kawaihae Harbor built a 56-foot long double-hulled voyaging canoe called the Alingano Maisu.
      In 2007, the Alingano Maisu,
      accompanied by the H&#333;k&#363;le&#699;a, embarked on her maiden voyage to her new home in Satawal so Papa Mau can carry on his legacy of navigation in his home islands.
      Leaving Hawai`i, H&#333;k&#363;le&#699;a led the way to Johnston Atoll.
      From there, the Alingano Maisu took the lead as they entered Micronesia by first stopping at Majuro, Marshall Islands before continuing on to her new home in Satawal.
      It is known that the island of Majuro is 1,108 nautical miles to the east and 575 nautical miles to the south of Johnston Atoll.
      What house do you need to sail towards and what distance will you need to sail?
      If the wa&#699;a travels at 5 knots,
      how many days will it take to reach the destination?
      Note that 1 knot = 1 nautical mile/hour.

      You may notice that for our given angle, <m>\theta</m>,
      we have the opposite side, 575 NM, and the adjacent side, 1,100 NM, which are all related with the tangent function
      <me>
        \tan\theta=\frac{575}{1,100}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Up until now,
      we were given the angles for the trigonometric problems we've encountered.
      To solve for the angle <m>\theta</m>,
      we cannot simply divide by
      <q>tan</q>
      because it is part of the tangent function where we input an angle and the output is a ratio of sides.
      Instead, we will need to use the inverse function in which we input the ratio of sides and output an angle.

    <title>Inverse Trigonometric Functions</title>
    <p>
      Recall (from Unit 1) that for a function <m>f</m> and its inverse function <m>f^{-1}</m>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            The Domain of <m>f^{-1}=</m> Range of <m>f</m>

          <p>
            The Range of <m>f^{-1}=</m> Domain of <m>f</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            If <m>f(a)=b</m> then <m>f^{-1}(b)=a</m>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      In terms of trigonometric functions, for example,
      if <m>f(x)=\sin x</m> then <m>f^{-1}(x)=\sin^{-1}x</m>.
      Now consider <m>\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}</m>,
      then <m>\frac{\pi}{4}=\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)</m>. \begin{mybox}[Be Careful] Do not confuse the inverse trigonometric notations with an exponent,
      in other words, <m>\sin^{-1}x\neq\frac{1}{\sin x}</m>.
      To avoid this,
      we will use parentheses around the trigonometric function to denote the power of negative one:
      <m>(\sin x)^{-1}</m>. \end{mybox}
    </p>
    <p>
      Also recall
      (from Unit 1)
      that for a function, <m>f</m>,
      to have an inverse, <m>f^{-1}</m>, it must be one-to-one,
      meaning no horizontal line intersects the graph more than once.
      Since this is not true for trigonometric functions,
      they do not have inverses.
      We need functions to be one-to-one because both <m>\sin\frac{\pi}{4}=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}</m> and
      <m>\sin\frac{3\pi}{4}=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}</m> but if we took the inverse of sine,
      would we wouldn't know to use
      <m>\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)=\frac{\pi}{4}</m> or <m>\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)=\frac{3\pi}{4}</m>.
      To avoid this confusion and to ensure the function is one-to-one,
      we can put restrictions on the domains of each trigonometric function so they attain all the values in the range only once,
      making the function one-to-one, and thus have an inverse
      (see <xref ref="fig_sine-not-one-to-one">Figure</xref>).
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig_sine-not-one-to-one">
      <caption>The graph of <m>f(x)=\sin x</m> does not pass the horizontal line test and is not one-to-one. If we restrict the graph to <m>-\frac{\pi}{2}\leq x\leq\frac{\pi}{2}</m> so that each value in the range <m>[-1,1]</m> is attained only once, then the function is one-to-one and has an inverse.</caption>
