  <title>Pacific Island Navigation</title>
    <introduction>
  <p>
    Pacific Islanders have been navigating across long distances in the Pacific long 
    before the magnetic compasses or other modern instruments were introduced. 
    Navigators relied on observations of the stars, sun, ocean, winds, habits of sea 
    and winged creatures, and other terrestrial and marine signs from nature to 
    determine their position relative to the direction of known or meaningful 
    locales – islands, reefs, continents – around them. Through time, much of the art 
    and science of traditional navigating was lost across the Pacific, except in some 
    islands, mostly in Micronesia and on the island of Taumako in the Solomon Islands, 
    where traditional schools continued to produce ocean going canoes and 
    individuals – navigators – capable of voyaging long distances through the 
    instrumentalization of deep knowledge about the natural world.

    <p>
      Navigators in Micronesia use the <em>paafu</em><idx><h>paafu</h></idx> mat or 
      map (shown in <xref ref="paafu">Figure</xref>), often mistranslated and misconstrued as a Star 
      <q>Compass</q> for its use of stars and constellations to discern direction, but 
      paafu is similar but not equivalent to the use of stars to mark cardinal 
      directionality (the familiar marking of space in terms of North, South, East and 
      West <q>cardinal points</q> for which compasses are known). Instead, paafu is a 
      learning and teaching tool that was developed to begin to teach the locational 
      position of an island (or a locale, or even a canoe) relative to other locales 
      as these are <q>marked</q> by rising and setting points of stars and constellations.

<p>
A constellation is a cluster of stars whose shapes and meanings reflect and carry 
cultural meanings or significance, such as the cluster of stars, prominent in the 
southern hemisphere, that is cruciform in shape and is commonly referred to in modern 
society as the <q>Southern Cross.</q> The same constellation for the Polowatese and other 
islanders from the Central Carolines region in the western Pacific islands resembles 
for them the trigger fish Pup, and so is named as such. In the Central Carolines, the 
general location in the celestial sky where stars appear to rise after sundown is 
referred to as <q><em>tan</em>,</q> which is often mistranslated as <q>east</q> since 
modern society refers to stars (like the sun) as <q>rising</q> in the east. Indeed, tan 
means <q>rising.</q> It does not mean <q>Eastward.</q>
</p>

<p>
<xref ref="paafu">Figure</xref> orients the cardinal direction known as <q>east</q> at the top of 
the page, and so the top half of this diagram is also identified as <q>tan</q> – where 
stars appear to rise. Following an apparent <q>path</q> across the sky each night and 
day (although most stars are not visible during the day) and across a year – in this 
system, the rising and presence of specific stars across the sky mark months, the same 
stars will eventually set at a point horizontally opposite where they rose. 
Corresponding to the cardinal direction point called <q>west,</q> this part of the circle 
is referred to as <q><em>tolon</em></q> or where the stars <q>set</q> or go down. In the 
paafu <q>map</q> in <xref ref="paafu">Figure</xref>, whose center is the figure of a canoe, the 
star called Mailap (Altair) marks due east. Where and when Mailap rises is referred 
to as Tan Mailap (rising Mailap) and when and where it sets is referred to as Tolon 
Mailap (setting Mailap). In <xref ref="paafu">Figure</xref>, east or the rising points of the 
navigation or paafu stars is situated at the top of the circle, and west or the setting 
points of these stars is situated at the bottom of the circle. As a map, paafu uses the 
rising and setting points of stars to mark places around any given locale that would be 
placed in the center of the circle (see <xref ref="tab_paafu">Table</xref>). Paafu can also be used 
to identify the direction that moving objects, like canoes, or creatures, like birds, 
fish, and humans, are heading or coming from. In this version of paafu, the stars are 
identified using the Polowat dialect of the Chuukese language as it is used by members 
of the Weriyeng School of navigation.

  <p>
    In the star compass, whose center is the figure of an ʻiwa or great frigatebird, 
    Thompson divides the visual horizon into 32 equidistant points around a circle, 
    called houses. The houses in the Hawaiian Star Compass represent a space on the 
    horizon (<m>11.25^{\circ}</m>) where celestial bodies such as the sun, stars, 
    moon, and planets rise and set. In the same way that we have addresses to help 
    people find our homes, each celestial body has its own address represented with 
    these houses.
  </p>
  <p>
    The four cardinal points correspond to a house.
    The stars arrive from the horizon called <em>Hikina</em>
    (<q>To Arrive</q>) or East and enter the horizon called <em>Komohana</em>
    (<q>To Enter</q>) or West.
    If you stand with your back towards Hikina (East) and face Komohana (West),
    your right will point towards <em>ʻĀkau</em>
    (<q>Right</q>) or North and your left will point towards <em>Hema</em>
    (<q>Left</q>) or South. The Hawaiian Star Compass is oriented with North at 
    the top of the compass.
  </p>
  <p>
    These four cardinal points divide the compass into four quadrants.
    Each quadrant is named after winds in Hawaiʻi.
    <em>Koʻolau</em> is the Northeast quadrant named for the trade winds;
    <em>Hoʻolua</em> is the Northwest quadrant,
    <em>Kona</em> is the Southwest quadrant;
    and <em>Malanai</em> is the Southeast quadrant.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each house on the compass has a name.
    The corresponding houses in the east and in the west share a name.
    Starting in the east or west and moving northwards and southwards 
    is the first house positioned on either side of Hikina (East) and Komohana (West).
    This is the house Lā (Sun).
    It is followed by ʻĀina (Land), Noio (Tern), Manu (Bird), Nālani (Heavens), Nā Leo (Voices),
    and Haka (Empty).
    The 32 houses in the Hawaiian Star Compass correspond to the points of the 32-wind compass rose
    (<xref ref="tab_compass">Table</xref>).
    The celestial bodies move in parallel paths across the sky from East to West,
    rising and setting in the same house,
    remaining in its hemisphere
    (<xref ref="fig_celestial-sphere">Figure</xref>).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For example,
    if a star arrives in the Koʻolau (northeastern) quadrant in the star house ʻĀina,
    it will arc overhead,
    staying in the northern hemisphere and enters the horizon in the same house it arrived in, ʻĀina,
    but in the Hoʻolua (northwest) quadrant, see Figure <xref ref="fig_celestial-sphere"/>.
    If a star arrives in the Malanai (southeast) quadrant in the house Lā, it will remain in the southern hemisphere as it arcs overhead and enters the horizon in the house Lā in the Kona (southwestern) quadrant.
  </p>
  <figure xml:id="fig_celestial-sphere">
    <caption>
      In the Celestial Sphere, stars rise in the East, move over the sky and set in the West. 
      A star will rise and set in the same house.
    </caption>
    <interactive geogebra="nmjdg3kb" aspect="1.75:1"/>
  </figure>
  <p>
    The star compass is also used to determine direction based on wind and ocean swells.
    As the wind and swells move, they cross the star compass diagonally.
    If a wind is blowing from the house Noio in the Koʻolau (northeast) quadrant,
    it would blow in the direction of the Kona (southwest) quadrant and exit at the same house it originated from, Noio.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now that we know the star compass,
    you may be asking how do we tell direction?
    To do this, we use observations.
    At night, Thompson uses about 220 stars to tell direction,
    memorizing where they rise and set on horizon.
    During the day when the sun is low on the horizon,
    we can use the sun but as it gets higher,
    you no longer are able to tell where on the horizon it came from.
    You can also memorize where the wind and waves are coming from and check to see if it has changed direction between sunrise and sunset.

  <title>Marshall Islands</title>
  <p>
    The Marshallese people use stick charts as navigational tools. These stick charts are indeed constructed using a 
    lattice-like structure made from curved and straight sticks, typically formed by tying together the midribs of 
    coconut fronds. The curved sticks represent the islands and how they bend and refract the ocean swells, 
    while the straight sticks symbolize the major wave patterns in the surrounding waters.
  </p>
  <p>
    The shells placed on the sticks indicate the relative locations of islands within the Marshall Islands archipelago. 
    These shells serve as markers, helping navigators remember the positions of specific islands along their voyages.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each stick chart is unique to its creator, reflecting their individual knowledge and experiences. 
    The personalization of the stick charts allows navigators to develop a deep understanding of the ocean currents, 
    wave patterns, and island locations in their specific region.
  </p>
  <p>
    The stick charts serve as mental maps or navigational aids, allowing experienced navigators to visualize and 
    recall the complex information while on their journeys. Navigators would memorize the stick charts, 
    internalizing the knowledge embedded within them, enabling them to navigate the open ocean.

    In addition to the star compass,
    many cultures across the Pacific use a
    <em>wind compass</em>.
    Similar to the star compass, the wind compass is also a mental construct.

    Other Pacific Island cultures have also adapted the modern Hawaiian Star Compass to their languages, as illustrated in <xref ref="other-pacific-star-compass-32-compass-rose">Figure</xref>.
