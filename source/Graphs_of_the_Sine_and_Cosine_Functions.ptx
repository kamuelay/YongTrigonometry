  <introduction>
    <p>
      The primary cause of the changing seasons and variation in sunlight distribution throughout the year is Earth's axial tilt. The axial tilt represents the angle between the Earth's rotational axis and its orbital plane around the Sun. To conceptualize this tilt, envision a pole passing through the Earth's center, extending from the North to South Pole, with the Earth revolving around this axis. Each complete rotation of the Earth on this axis corresponds to one day. As the Earth travels along its orbit around the Sun, either the North Pole or South Pole tilts toward the Sun, and this phenomenon is referred to as <term>axial tilt</term>.
      <idx><h>axial tilt</h></idx>
    </p>
    <p>
      During the equinoxes, which mark the transition from winter to spring and from summer to fall, the Earth's axis is not tilted towards or away from the Sun. Consequently, on these days, the Sun rises due east and sets due west, and the duration of day and night is approximately equal.
    </p>

    </figure> -->
    <p>
      Following the <term>fall equinox</term>
      <idx><h>equinox</h><h>fall</h></idx> in the Southern Hemisphere, typically occurring around March 20th, the Earth proceeds along its orbit around the Sun, leading the Southern Hemisphere to tilt away from the Sun. As a result, the Sun's rising position progressively moves northward each day. By the time of the <term>winter solstice</term>,
      <idx><h>solstice</h><h>winter</h></idx> around June 20th, the Sun rises from its northernmost position, resulting in the shortest day in the Southern Hemisphere and the longest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the winter solstice, the Earth's axial tilt remains the same, but the Southern Hemisphere starts tilting toward the Sun. This causes the Sun's rising position to gradually shift southward each day. When the <term>spring equinox</term>
      <idx><h>equinox</h><h>spring</h></idx> arrives, approximately on September 22nd, the Sun rises due east once again, and day and night are once more of equal duration.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the Southern Hemisphere continues to tilt towards the Sun, the Sun's rising position moves even further south each day. By the time of the <term>summer solstice</term>,
      <idx><h>solstice</h><h>summer</h></idx> approximately on December 21st, the Sun rises from its southernmost position, resulting in the longest day of the year in the Southern Hemisphere and the shortest day in the Northern Hemisphere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following the summer solstice, the Southern Hemisphere begins tilting away from the Sun, causing the Sun's rising position to gradually shift northward each day. This movement continues until the next fall equinox, completing the annual cycle.
    </p>

      The position where the Sun rises throughout the year exhibits a repeating pattern, characterized as a <term>periodic function</term> with a cycle of about one year. This function can be mathematically represented as either a sine or cosine function. Graphically, it illustrates the sunrise position on the horizon relative to the east (Hikina) as time progresses. By examining this function, we can observe the gradual northward and southward movement of the sunrise position throughout the year. Key dates such as the equinoxes and solstices mark significant points in this pattern, providing insights into the changing seasons and variations in daylight hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this section, we will explore the graphs of the sine and cosine functions through their periodic nature. Studying the graphs of sine and cosine functions provides valuable insights into the world around us. The graphs of the remaining trigonometric functions that were discussed in <xref ref="Trigonometry">Chapter</xref> will be covered in <xref ref="Graphs_of_Other_Trigonometric_Functions">Section</xref>.

      In <xref ref="Trigonometry">Chapter</xref>, trigonometric functions typically use <m>\theta</m> or <m>t</m> as the variable in the domain, such as <m>y=\cos\theta</m> and <m>y=\sin t</m>. However, when graphing functions on the Cartesian plane (<m>xy</m>-coordinate system), <m>x</m> is conventionally used as the variable in the domain. Therefore, when graphing trigonometric functions, we will use <m>x</m> as the variable, for example <m>y=\cos x</m> and <m>y=\sin x</m>.

      Recall that if <m>\theta</m> is an angle with radian measure <m>t</m>,

    <p>
      Division is not required for the trigonometric functions <m>\sin\theta</m> and
      <m>\cos\theta</m> and so we do not need to worry about dividing by zero,
      thus <m>\theta</m> can be any angle.
      In other words, the domains for <m>\sin\theta</m> and
      <m>\cos\theta</m> consist of the set of all real numbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, looking at <m>\tan\theta</m> and <m>\sec\theta</m>,
      you may notice there is division by <m>x</m>.
      We run into problems when <m>x=0</m> because it would result in dividing by 0.
      These are the points when the terminal side of <m>\theta</m> lies on the <m>y</m>-axis.
      On the unit circle, the points are <m>(0,1)</m> and <m>(0,-1)</m>.
      These points correspond to the angles <m>\frac{\pi}{2}</m> and
      <m>\frac{3\pi}{2}</m> (<m>90^{\circ}</m> and <m>270^{\circ}</m>),
      as well as all their coterminal angles:
      <m>\ldots, -\frac{3\pi}{2}, \frac{-\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{3\pi}{2}, \frac{5\pi}{2}, \ldots</m>
      (<m>\ldots, -270^{\circ}, -90^{\circ}, 90^{\circ}, 270^{\circ}, 450^{\circ}, \ldots</m>).
      In general, any angle of the form
      <m>\frac{\pi}{2}+n\pi</m> (<m>90^{\circ}+180^{\circ}\cdot n</m>) for some integer <m>n</m> should be excluded from the domain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, we run into problems for <m>\csc\theta</m> and
      <m>\cot\theta</m> when <m>y=0</m> since we would divide by 0.
      This corresponds to when the terminal side of <m>\theta</m> lies on the <m>x</m>-axis.
      These points on the unit circle are <m>(1,0)</m> and <m>(-1,0)</m> and have corresponding angles <m>0</m> and <m>\pi</m>,
      as well as all their coterminal angles:
      <m>\ldots, -2\pi, -\pi, 0, \pi, 2\pi, \ldots</m>
      (<m>\ldots, -360^{\circ}, -180^{\circ}, 0^{\circ}, 180^{\circ}, 360^{\circ}, \ldots</m>).
      In general, any angle of the form
      <m>\pi\cdot n</m> (<m>180^{\circ}\cdot n</m>) for some integer <m>n</m> should be excluded from the domain.

      Next we look at the range for each of the trigonometric functions.
      If <m>P(x,y)</m> is a point on the unit circle,
      then we have <m>-1\leq x\leq1</m> and <m>-1\leq y\le1</m>.
      Since <m>\sin\theta=y</m> and <m>\cos\theta=x</m>,
      it follows that <m>-1\leq\sin\theta\leq1</m> and <m>-1\leq\cos\theta\leq1</m>.

          Talk about the importance of this and how when it rises at sunset,
          it coincides with the start of Makahiki season.
          Then using an example that we already worked with the sun and the time the sun sets over the year,
          find the intersection of these two equations to determine when Makahiki season will begin.

          ``The rising of Makali`i
          (the constellation Pleiades)
          at sunset marks the beginning of the Hawaiian new year,
          known as Makahiki.
          Makahiki usally begins mid-November and ends in late January or February,
          aligning with the rainy season.
          It is a time set aside for tribute, harvest, sport,
          and play. " "<url href="\1"/>

    Problem 55, p540 in Abramson's book: Standing on the shore of a lake,
          a fisherman sights a boat far in the distance to his left.
          Let x, measured in radians,
          be the angle formed by the line of sight to the ship and a line due north from his position.
          Assume due north is 0 and x is measured negative to the left and positive to the right.
          (See Figure 19.)
          The boat travels from due west to due east and,
          ignoring the curvature of the Earth,
          the distance d(x), in kilometers,
          from the fisherman to the boat is given by the function d(x) = 1.5sec(x).
