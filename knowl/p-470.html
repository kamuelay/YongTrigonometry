<p>The seasons on Earth are caused by axial tilt. To visual axial tilt, image a pole through the center of Earth and extending through the North and South Pole with Earth spinning around this pole. Each spin is one day. As the Earth revolves around the sun, the North Pole tilts towards the sun and sometimes the South Pole tilts towards the sun, this tilting is call <em class="emphasis">axial tilt</em>.  When the North Pole is closer to the Sun (the South Pole is away from the Sun), the Northern Hemisphere experiences summer (the Southern Hemisphere experiences winter). When the axial tilt is reversed and the North Pole is further from the Sun (South Pole is close to the Sun), the seasons are reversed.</p>
