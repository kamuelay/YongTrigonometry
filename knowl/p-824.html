<p>The Polynesian Triangle is an area in the Pacific Ocean consisting of over 1,000 islands. These islands are collectively known as Polynesia. The northern corner of the Polynesian Triangle is made up of the Hawaiian Islands, the southwestern corner is made up of Aotearoa, and the southeastern corner is made up with Rapa Nui. It is believed that the first inhabitants to the islands arrived at Ka Lae, Hawai`i; Hokianga, Aotearoa; and Anakena, Rapa Nui, respectively. The distance between Ka Lae, Hawai`i and Hokianga, Aotearoa is 4,250 miles, the distance between Hokianga, Aotearoa and Anakena, Rapa Nui is 4,500 miles, and the distance between Rapa Nui and Ka Lae, Hawai`i is 4,450 miles. What is the area of the Polynesian Triangle rounded to the nearest square mile?</p>
